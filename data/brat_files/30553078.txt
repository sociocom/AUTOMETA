Design of a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of a reproductive health survivorship care plan in young breast cancer survivors. Young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) have unmet needs for managing hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, sexual health, and contraception. Describe the design and participant characteristics of a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of the survivorship care plan on reproductive health (SCP-R) intervention on improving hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, sexual health, and contraception in YBCS. SCP-R is a web-based intervention with text message support encompassing evidence- based practices on four reproductive health issues. YBCS with â‰¥1 reproductive health issue are randomized to intervention (full SCP-R access) or attention control (access to list of online resources) arms with 24-week follow-up. The primary outcome will be improvement of at least one reproductive health issue measured by validated self-report instruments. Each YBCS nominated one healthcare provider (HCP), who can access the same materials as their patient. HCP outcomes are preparedness and confidence in discussing each issue. Among 318 YBCS screened, 57.2% underwent randomization. Mean age was 40.0 (SD 5.9), and mean age at cancer diagnosis was 35.6 (SD 5.4). Significant hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, vaginal symptoms, and inadequate contraception were reported by 50.5%, 50%, 46.7%, 62.1% of YBCS, respectively; 70.9% had multiple issues. Among 165 nominated HCPs, 32.7% enrolled. The majority of HCPs reported preparedness (68.5-90.7%) and confidence (50.0-74.1%) in discussing reproductive health issues with YBCS. HCPs were least likely to report preparedness or confidence in discussing fertility-related concerns. Conducting a trial for improving YBCS reproductive health online is feasible, providing a mechanism to disseminate evidence-based management.
