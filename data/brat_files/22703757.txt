Lanreotide Autogel 90 mg and lymphorrhea prevention after axillary node dissection in breast cancer: a phase III double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Lanreotide Autogel 90 mg PR to prevent lymphorrhea after axillary dissection in breast cancer. A Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed between April 1st, 2008, and December 31st, 2010. The primary endpoint was the lymphorrhea volume (ml) in the axillary drain during the first four postoperative days. The secondary end points were the number of days until axillary drain removal, hospital stay duration (days), lymphorrhea volume (ml) up to days 15, 30 and 180, number of cases with seroma aspiration and number of seroma aspirations, evaluation of wound, arm pain and mobility on days 15, 30 and 180. A total of 148 patients were recruited for the study. Altogether 145 patients were randomized and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. On the day before surgery 73 patients received the placebo and 72 patients received lanreotide. At four postoperative days, there was a tendency towards a reduction of the lymphorrhea volume in the lanreotide group (median 292 ml, range 1-965 ml) as compared to the placebo group (median 337 ml, range 0-1230 ml), although it was not statistically significant (p = 0.18). There was no significant difference for the secondary end points. In the group with axillary dissection performed alone (n = 24), the lymphorrhea volume was shown to be significantly reduced in the lanreotide group, (p = 0.035) as compared to the placebo group. Our study did not identify any overall significant reduction of lymphorrhea on lanreotide.
