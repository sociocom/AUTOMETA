[A multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase Ⅲ clinical study of PEG-rhG-CSF for preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer]. To explore the safety and efficacy of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) in preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to provide the basis for clinical application. According to the principle of open-label, randomized, parallel-group controlled clinical trial, all patients were randomized by 1∶1∶1 into three groups to receive PEG-rhG-CSF 100 μg/kg, PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg, or rhG-CSF 5 μg/kg, respectively. The patients with breast cancer received two chemotherapy cycles, and the NSCLC patients received 1-2 cycles of chemotherapy according to their condition. All patients were treated with the combination chemotherapy of TAC (docetaxel+ epirubicin+ cyclophosphamide) or TA (docetaxel+ epirubicin), or the chemotherapy of docetaxel combined with carboplatin, with a 21 day cycle. The duration of grade 3-4 neutropenia in the PEG-rhG-CSF 100 μg/kg and PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg groups were similar with that in the rhG-CSF 5 μg/kg group (P>0.05 for all). The incidence rate of grade 3-4 neutropenia in the PEG-rhG-CSF 100 μg/kg group, PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg group, and G-CSF 5 μg/kg group were 69.7%, 68.4%, and 69.5%, respectively, with a non-significant difference among the three groups (P=0.963). The incidence rate of febrile neutropenia in the PEG-rhG-CSF 100 μg/kg group, PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg group and G-CSF 5 μg/kg group were 6.1%, 6.4%, and 5.5%, respectively, showing no significant difference among them (P=0.935). The incidence rate of adverse events in the PEG-rhG-CSF 100 μg/kg group, PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg group and G-CSF 5 μg / kg group were 6.7%, 4.1%, and 5.5%, respectively, showing a non-significant difference among them (P=0.581). In patients with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing TAC/TA chemotherapy, a single 100 μg/kg injection or a single fixed 6 mg dose of PEG-rhG-CSF at 48 hours after chemotherapy show definite therapeutic effect with a low incidence of adverse events and mild adverse reactions. Compared with the continuous daily injection of rhG-CSF 5 μg/kg/d, a single 100 μg/kg injection or a single fixed 6 mg dose of PEG-rhG-CSF has similar effect and is more advantageous in preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
