Evaluation of Lymphedema Prevention Protocol on Quality of Life among Breast Cancer Patients with Mastectomy. Lymphedema is a widespread complication after surgery or radiation therapy due to the damage and obstruction of the lymphatic vessels. A study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of lymphedema prevention protocol on quality of life among breast cancer patients with mastectomy at a selected hospital in Tamil Nadu. Objectives of the study were to identify the effect of lymphedema prevention protocol on lymphedema occurrence and quality of life. A quantitative research approach of quasi experimental non-equivalent with control group before -after design (Non randomized) was used. The investigator had included 120 participants by using purposive sampling technique which included 60 each in study and comparison group. Pre test was done before the intervention of lymphedema prevention protocol to both comparison and study group participants. Lymphedema prevention protocol was implemented for study group whereas comparison group received routine care. Post tests 1, 2, 3, and 4 were done by using the structured questionnaire at 10th day, 30th, 60th and 90th post operative day respectively. Subjects' responses were coded and statistically analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics. The comparison of quality of life between study and comparison group over a period of time were statistically significant at p< 0.001 whereas lymphedema occurrence was significant at p< 0.01. The early execution of preventive measures of lymphedema prevents the lymphedema occurrence and promotes the quality of life among patients undergone mastectomy.
