The Effects of Ganglioside-Monosialic Acid in Taxane-Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity in Patients with Breast Cancer: A Randomized Trial. Taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) is a dose-limiting adverse effect. Ganglioside-monosialic acid (GM1) functions as a neuroprotective factor. We assessed the effects of GM1 on the prevention of TIPN in breast cancer patients. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including 206 patients with early-stage breast cancer planning to receive taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy with a follow-up of more than 1 year. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive GM1 (80 mg, day -1 to day 2) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment Neurotoxicity subscale score after four cycles of chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints included neurotoxicity evaluated by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group neuropathy scale. All statistical tests were two-sided. In 183 evaluable patients, the GM1 group reported better mean Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment Neurotoxicity subscale scores than patients in the placebo group after four cycles of chemotherapy (43.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 43.05 to 43.49 vs 34.34, 95% CI = 33.78 to 34.89; mean difference = 8.96, 95% CI = 8.38 to 9.54, P < .001). Grade 1 or higher peripheral neurotoxicity in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 scale was statistically significantly lower in the GM1 group (14.3% vs 100.0%, P < .001). Additionally, the GM1 group had a statistically significantly lower incidence of grade 1 or higher neurotoxicity assessed by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group neuropathy scale sensory neuropathy (26.4% vs 97.8%, P < .001) and motor neuropathy subscales (20.9% vs 81.5%, P < .001). The treatment with GM1 resulted in a reduction in the severity and incidence of TIPN after four cycles of taxane-containing chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.
