A Dietary Intervention to Lower Serum Levels of IGF-I in BRCA Mutation Carriers. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and other markers of insulin resistance (IRm) might influence the penetrance of BRCA gene mutation. In a demonstration project on BRCA mutation carriers we tested the effect of the 'Mediterranean diet', with moderate protein restriction, on serum levels of IGF-I and IRm. BRCA mutation carriers, with or without breast cancer, aged 18‚Åª70 years and without metastases were eligible. After the baseline examinations, women were randomized to an active dietary intervention or to a control group. The intervention group attended six full days of life-style intervention activities (cookery classes followed by lunch, sessions of walking for 45 min and nutritional conferences) over the next six months. 213 BRCA mutation carriers completed the six-month study. Women in the intervention group (110) showed major changes in all the parameters under study. They significantly lost weight (p < 0.001), fat mass (p = 0.002), with reduced hip circumference (p = 0.01), triglycerides (p = 0.02) and IGF-I (p = 0.02) compared with controls. They also had a significantly higher levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFI-BP3) (p = 0.03) and a lower IGF-I/IGFI-BP3 ratio (p = 0.04). The reduction of serum levels of IGF-I was significantly associated with the reduction in the consumption of animal products (p = 0.04). Women in the intervention group showed significant improvements in IGF-I and in other IRm that might influence the penetrance of BRCA mutations.
