A randomized, prospective study of endometrial resection to prevent recurrent endometrial polyps in women with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen. To assess the role of endometrial resection in preventing recurrence of tamoxifen-associated endometrial polyps in women with breast cancer. Randomized, prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification I). Tertiary university-affiliated medical center. Twenty consecutive women (age range 43-61 yrs). Hysteroscopic removal of tamoxifen-associated endometrial polyps with or without simultaneous resection of the endometrium. Patients were randomized to undergo (10 women) or not undergo (10) concomitant endometrial resection. They were followed for at least 18 months (range 18-24 mo), including transvaginal ultrasonography every 6 months and hysteroscopy when endometrial irregularity was noted. The main outcome variable was recurrence of endometrial polyps; occurrence of uterine bleeding was also noted. In women who underwent endometrial resection, only one had a 1 x 1-cm endometrial polyp diagnosed and removed during follow-up. Seven women remained amenorrheic, and three experienced spotting for a few days every month. In the control group, six women had recurrent endometrial polyps requiring hysteroscopic removal (two-tail Fisher's exact test p <0.06). Recurrence of endometrial polyps, one of the most common problems in patients with breast cancer receiving long-term treatment with tamoxifen, may be reduced by performing endometrial resection at the time of hysteroscopic removal of polyps. The possible risk of occult endometrial cancer is yet to be determined. (J Am Assoc Gynecol Laparosc 6(3):285-288, 1999)
