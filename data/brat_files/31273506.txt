Novel hyaluronan formulation for preventing acute skin reactions in breast during radiotherapy: a randomized clinical trial. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial to investigate the use of a new proprietary hyaluronan (HA) formulation for the prevention of acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). Thirty women with breast cancer undergoing whole breast RT were enrolled. Each patient was randomly assigned to HA formulation (study cream, S) on the medial or lateral half of the irradiated breast and the control cream (placebo, P) on the other half. The primary endpoint was physician's evaluation of skin symptoms at week 5 during RT and week 2 post-RT. We also collected patients' independent assessment of skin after RT, patient's product preference, and an independent physician panel assessment of skin reactions based on photographs. Twenty-eight patients were evaluable. On physician's evaluation, there was no significant difference in radiation dermatitis between S and P and no overall preference to either cream at week 5 during or week 2 post-RT. More patients preferred S in evaluating skin appearance and skin reactions, but this did not reach statistical significance. Univariate analysis showed that physicians had an overall preference to the S cream at week 2 post-RT in patients with larger breasts. On the independent panel assessment, 3 reviewers saw no significant difference in radiation toxicity, whereas one reviewer reported better skin outcome with S cream at week 5. We found a nonstatistically significant patient preference but overall no significant radioprotective effects for this HA formulation compared with placebo except in patients with larger breasts. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02165605).
