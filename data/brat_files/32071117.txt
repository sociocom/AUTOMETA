The Effects of a Remote-based Weight Loss Program on Adipocytokines, Metabolic Markers, and Telomere Length in Breast Cancer Survivors: the POWER-Remote Trial. We initiated a clinical trial to determine the proportion of breast cancer survivors achieving ≥5% weight loss using a remotely delivered weight loss intervention (POWER-remote) or a self-directed approach, and to determine the effects of the intervention on biomarkers of cancer risk including metabolism, inflammation, and telomere length. Women with stage 0-III breast cancer, who completed local therapy and chemotherapy, with a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 were randomized to a 12-month intervention (POWER-remote) versus a self-directed approach. The primary objective was to determine the number of women who achieved at least 5% weight loss at 6 months. We assessed baseline and 6-month change in a panel of adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin, resistin, HGF, NGF, PAI1, TNFα, MCP1, IL1β, IL6, and IL8), metabolic factors (insulin, glucose, lipids, hs-CRP), and telomere length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. From 2013 to 2015, 96 women were enrolled, and 87 were evaluable for the primary analysis; 45 to POWER-remote and 42 to self-directed. At 6 months, 51% of women randomized to POWER-remote lost ≥5% of their baseline body weight, compared with 12% in the self-directed arm [OR, 7.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.6-23.9; P = 0.0003]; proportion were similar at 12 months (51% vs 17%, respectively, P = 0.003). Weight loss correlated with significant decreases in leptin, and favorable modulation of inflammatory cytokines and lipid profiles. There was no significant change in telomere length at 6 months. A remotely delivered weight loss intervention resulted in significant weight loss in breast cancer survivors, and favorable effects on several biomarkers.
