A prospective randomized controlled trial of hydrating nail solution for prevention or treatment of onycholysis in breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant/adjuvant docetaxel chemotherapy. Onycholysis and other nail toxicities occur in approximately 20-30% of breast cancer (BC) patients receiving docetaxel chemotherapy. Onycholysis is often associated with painful paronychia, decreasing patients' quality of life. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of hydrating nail solution (HNS) (EVONAIL® solution, Evaux Laboratories, France) for the prevention and treatment of docetaxel-induced onycholysis and nail toxicities. This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled study of HNS for the prevention or treatment of onycholysis in patients with docetaxel after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide. In the experimental arm, patients painted HNS on nails and periungual areas once a day till developing onycholysis grade 2. After grade 2 onycholysis development, patients applied HNS twice a day regardless of treatment arm. The primary endpoints were the incidence of onycholysis grade 2 and recovery rate from grade 2 onycholysis. From August 2015 to May 2016, 103 patients were enrolled and completed this study. Of these, 25 cases of grade 1 and 22 of grade 2 onycholysis were observed. Prophylactic application of HNS resulted in a statistically significant reduction of grade 2 onycholysis compared to controls (P = 0.001) and all grade onycholysis was also significantly lower in the experimental arm (P = 0.034). Multivariate analysis showed that HNS decreased grade 2 onycholysis (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.366, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.148, 0.902; P = 0.029) and all grade onycholysis (HR 0.372, 95% CI 0.201-0.687, P = 0.002). Hydrating nail solution significantly reduced the incidence of docetaxel-induced onycholysis in BC patients (NCT02670603).
