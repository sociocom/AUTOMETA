Effect of β-glucan on drain fluid and amount of drainage following modified radical mastectomy. To reduce the seroma formation following mastectomy and axillary dissection, many different techniques and drugs have been investigated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of oral β-glucan on drain fluid and efficacy of daily drainage and drain removal day in mastectomy patients. One hundred and thirty breast cancer patients of Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital were divided into 2 groups by consecutive randomization (n = 65 each). β-glucan 10 mg capsules were administered to Group 1 twice a day for 10 days. Group 2 took placebos in the same manner. Age, menarche age, menopause, parity, history of oral contraceptives, comorbidities, postoperative daily drainage volumes and drain removal days were recorded and compared. Seroma samples during the first and second day of drainage were taken for analysis of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α). There was no difference between groups in terms of age, menarche age, menopause period, parity, oral contraceptive use and comorbidities. Group 1 showed significantly lower daily drainage volumes between days 2 and 8. Mean drain removal day was 7.16 ± 1.72 in Group 1 and 8.59 ± 2.27 in Group 2. The difference was significant (p < 0.001). TNF-α and IL-6 levels on days 1 and 2 in Group 1 were significantly lower (p < 0.001). In addition, β-glucan significantly shortened the number of days required for the drain removal in patients who have comorbidities (p = 0.018). The earliest removal was in patients without comorbidity and who received β-glucan (p = 0.002). β-glucan decreased drain discharges after mastectomy. The drains were removed earlier in β-glucan administered patients.
