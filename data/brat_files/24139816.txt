[Interest of a thrombin and fibrinogen combipatch in preventing breast cancer seroma after lymph node dissection]. To evaluate the effect of combipatch TachoSil(®) in the prevention of seromas after axillary dissection in local breast cancer. PATIENTS ET MÉTHODES: A retrospective, case-control study conducted between January 2007 and December 2009, in two departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the AP-HP. Sixty-six patients (45 in the control group and 22 in the group TachoSil(®)) who have undergone an axillary dissection alone, with establishment of a redon or with lumpectomy, were included. The total amount of lymph drained during the stay, the number of days of drainage, duration of hospitalization, the number of lymphoceles and the number of retrievals performed at the waning of hospitalization were collected. The population was similar in age, body mass index (BMI), clinical and pathological data. There was no significant difference in terms of total volume of lymph drained (268.2 ± 220.7 mL without TachoSil(®) and 228.6 ± 128.8 mL with TachoSil(®), P = 0.89) and the number of days of drainage (3.9 ± 1.6 days without TachoSil(®) and 3.1 ± 0.9 days with TachoSil(®), P = 0.10). The duration of hospitalization was significantly higher in the group TachoSil(®) (5 ± 1.6 days with TachoSil(®) and 3.8 ± 1.1 days without TachoSil(®), P = 0.006). This study shows no benefit of combipatch (TachoSil(®)) in prevention of seromas after axillary lymph node dissection. A randomized study with large effective is necessary.
