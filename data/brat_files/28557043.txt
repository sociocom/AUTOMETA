A psychological intervention programme for patients with breast cancer under chemotherapy and at a high risk of depression: A randomised clinical trial. To develop a nurse-led psychological intervention programme and to evaluate its effects on psychological distress and quality of life in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy and at a high risk of depression. Depression is common among patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Psychological intervention programmes that improve psychological distress and quality of life have previously been lacking in South Korea. This was a pre- and post-test randomised controlled trial. The nurse-led psychological intervention programme comprised seven weekly counselling sessions delivered face to face and telephonically. These aimed to provide emotional support to patients and to enable them to express their feelings. Patients at a high risk of depression were recruited from an oncology outpatient clinic in a university hospital. Sixty participants were evenly and randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. The effects of the intervention on psychological distress (mood disturbance, anxiety and depression) and quality of life were examined using linear mixed models. Compared with the control group, the intervention group reported significantly lower mood disturbance, anxiety and depression and showed an improved global health status and physical, role and emotional functions. They also reported fewer symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain and insomnia. Our nurse-led psychological intervention programme might reduce patients' uncertainty and encourage them to be proactive and self-controllable. Nurse-led psychological intervention programmes should be implemented to reduce psychological distress and improve quality of life in patients with breast cancer, particularly those at a high risk of depression.
