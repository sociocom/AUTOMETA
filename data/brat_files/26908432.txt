Effect of Weight Loss with or without Exercise on Inflammatory Markers and Adipokines in Postmenopausal Women: The SHAPE-2 Trial, A Randomized Controlled Trial. We investigated the effect of equivalent weight loss, by a hypocaloric diet or mainly exercise, on inflammatory markers and adipokines in overweight postmenopausal women. Women were randomized to a diet (n = 97), mainly exercise (n = 98), or control group (n = 48). Goal of both interventions was to lose 5 to 6 kg bodyweight by a hypocaloric diet or an exercise program (4 hours/week) combined with a small caloric intake restriction. Outcomes after 16 weeks included serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), IL6, adiponectin, and leptin. Both intervention groups achieved the target weight loss. Controls remained weight stable. Compared with control, hsCRP decreased with mainly exercise [treatment effect ratio (TER) = 0.64] and borderline statistically significant with diet (TER = 0.77). There was a suggestively larger effect of exercise, directly compared with diet (TER = 0.83). Leptin decreased with both interventions: mainly exercise (TER = 0.55) and diet (TER = 0.59), versus control. Effects attenuated and lost significance after adjusting for change in body fat percentage, and to a lesser extent when adjusting for fitness. No effects were seen on IL6 and adiponectin. A 16-week randomized intervention inducing comparable weight loss by a hypocaloric diet or mainly exercise, resulted in favorable effects on serum hsCRP and leptin. We found a possible more beneficial effect on hsCRP with mainly exercise versus diet. These effects of exercise were established by changes in body fat percentage and physical fitness. A modest amount of weight loss in postmenopausal women reduces hsCRP and leptin levels which might be associated with a lower breast cancer risk. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(5); 799-806.
