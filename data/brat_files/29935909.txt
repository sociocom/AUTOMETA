A Randomized, Single-Blind Study Evaluating the Effect of a Bone Pain Education Video on Reported Bone Pain in Patients with Breast Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy and Pegfilgrastim. Mild-to-moderate bone pain is the most commonly reported adverse event associated with pegfilgrastim. To investigate the effect of bone pain education on pegfilgrastim-related bone pain in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim. Randomized, single-blind study. Forty-eight community oncology clinics throughout the United States. Three hundred women ≥18 years of age with newly diagnosed stage I -III breast cancer, who were planning ≥4 cycles of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy with pegfilgrastim support starting in cycle 1. Patients were randomized 1:1 to view a general education DVD on chemotherapy side effects (GE-DVD) or a DVD on bone pain following chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim (BP-DVD). Patients recorded severity of bone pain on a scale of 0-10, location of pain, and use of bone pain medications (i.e., analgesics, antihistamines, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for 5 days, beginning on the day of pegfilgrastim administration, in each of the first four chemotherapy cycles. Patient-reported maximum bone pain was similar in the two groups (GE-DVD vs BP-DVD: cycle 1, 3.2 vs. 3.5, p = .3479; across all cycles, 4.1 vs. 4.6, p = .2196). Other measures of bone pain were also similar between the groups. Bone pain was highest in cycle 1 but decreased and then remained stable in subsequent cycles. Bone pain medication use was similar in both groups and was highest in cycle 1. The bone pain-specific education evaluated here did not improve perceptions of bone pain reported in this patient population.
