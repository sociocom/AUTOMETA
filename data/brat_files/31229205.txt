Prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with classical massage in breast cancer patients receiving paclitaxel: An assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial. This assessor-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial aimed at investigating the effect of classical massage on chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy and the quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant paclitaxel. A total of 40 female breast cancer patients were randomly allocated to the classical massage group (CMG) or the control group (CG). Classical massage was applied to the patients in the CMG before each paclitaxel infusion. The CG received only usual care. Presence of peripheral neuropathic pain and QOL were assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) findings were also recorded at baseline and week 12. The peripheral neuropathic pain was lower in the CMG compared to the CG at week 12 (p < 0.05). The sensory and motor sub-scale scores of the QOL measure showed statistically significant differences over time in favor of the CMG (p < 0.05). Sensory action potential amplitude of the median nerve was significantly higher and the tibial nerve latency was significantly shorter in the CMG compared to the CG at week 12. This study suggested that classical massage successfully prevented chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain, improved the QOL, and showed beneficial effects on the NCS findings.
