[Preventive effect of low-dose carvedilol combined with candesartan on the cardiotoxicity of anthracycline drugs in the adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer]. To investigate the effect of low-dose carvedilol combined with candesartan in the prevention of acute and chronic cardiotoxicity of anthracycline drugs in adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer. Forty patients were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group with chemotherapy plus low-dose carvedilol combined with candesartan (20 cases) and control group with chemotherapy alone (20 cases). The same chemotherapy was given to the two groups. All the 40 patients had no contraindication for carvedilol and candesartan. Patients of the experimental group received low-dose carvedilol from 2.5 mg orally twice a day at first cycle to 5 mg twice a day gradually if no side reactions, and candesartan 2.5 mg orally once a day. Electrocardiogram, ultrasonic cardiogram, arrhythmia, troponin and non-hematologic toxicity were recorded and compared after the second, forth and sixth cycle of chemotherapy. Each cycle included 21 days. LVEF was decreased along with the prolongation of chemotherapy in the experimental group and control group. LVEDD and LVESD showed no significant changes in the experimental group, but gradually increased in the control group. After four and six cycles of chemotherapy, LVEF were (57.00 ± 5.13)% and (45.95 ± 3.68)%, respectively, in the control group, significantly lower than that of (67.00 ± 5.13)% and (57.50 ± 2.57)%, respectively, in the experimental group (P < 0.05). After six cycles of chemotherapy, LVEDD and LVESD were (50.00 ± 10.48) mm and (35.01 ± 2.99) mm, respectively, in the control group, significantly higher than those before chemotherapy (P < 0.05) and experimental group (P < 0.001). The rate of ST segment and T wave abnormalities was 80.0% in the control group after six cycles of chemotherapy, significantly higher than that of 25.0% after four cycles of chemotherapy (P = 0.001) and 10.0% after two cycles of chemotherapy (P < 0.001). The reduction of QRS voltage, arrhythmia and abnormal troponin were 55.0%, 45.0% and 45.0%, respectively, in the control group, significantly higher than those in the experimental group (20.0%, P < 0.05), (10.0%, P = 0.010) and (10.0%, P < 0.05), respectively. The rate of abnormal expression of troponin was 45.0% in the control group, significantly higher than the 10.0% in the experimental group (P < 0.05). The use of low-dose carvedilol combined with candesartan can reduce the acute and chronic cardiotoxicity of anthracycline drugs, and with tolerable toxicities. This may provide a new approach to prevent cardiotoxicity of anthracycline drugs in adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer.
