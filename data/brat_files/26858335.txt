A Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase III Study of Epoetin Alfa Versus Best Standard of Care in Anemic Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Receiving Standard Chemotherapy. An open-label, noninferiority study to evaluate the impact of epoetin alfa (EPO) on tumor outcomes when used to treat anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. Women with hemoglobin â‰¤ 11.0 g/dL, receiving first- or second-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer, were randomly assigned to EPO 40,000 IU subcutaneously once a week or best standard of care. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival, time to tumor progression, overall response rate, RBC transfusions, and thrombotic vascular events. In 2,098 patients randomly assigned, median PFS (based on investigator-determined disease progression [PD]) was 7.4 months in both groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.089; 95% CI, 0.988 to 1.200); upper bound exceeded prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.15. Median PFS per independent review committee-determined PD was 7.6 months in both groups (HR, 1.028; 95% CI, 0.922 to 1.146); upper bound did not exceed prespecified noninferiority margin. Median overall survival at clinical cutoff (1,337 deaths) was 17.2 months in the EPO and 17.4 months in the best standard of care group (HR, 1.057; 95% CI, 0.949 to 1.177), median time to tumor progression was 7.5 months in both groups (HR, 1.094; 95% CI, 0.991 to 1.209), and overall response rate was 50% versus 51% (odds ratio, 0.950; 95% CI, 0.799 to 1.130). RBC transfusions were 5.8% versus 11.4% (P < .001), and thrombotic vascular events were 2.8% versus 1.4% (P = .038), respectively. The primary end point, PFS based on investigator-determined PD, did not meet noninferiority criteria. As a consistency assessment with the primary finding, PFS based on independent review committee-determined PD met noninferiority criteria. Overall, this study did not achieve noninferiority objective in ruling out a 15% increased risk in PD/death. RBC transfusion should be the preferred approach for the management of anemia in this population.
