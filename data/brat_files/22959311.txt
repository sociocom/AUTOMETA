Axillary lymphadenectomy for breast cancer. A randomized controlled trial comparing a bipolar vessel sealing system to the conventional technique. To compare safety and efficacy of a bipolar vessel sealing system (BVSS) to the conventional technique in axillary node dissection. 116 women with breast cancer were randomized to conventional node dissection surgical technique (control; n = 58) by scalpel and monopolar cautery or using an electrothermal BVSS (study group; n = 58). The median (range) total volume of fluid collected by drain and aspirations was 305 (30-1420) mL in the study group and 335 (80-1070) mL in the control group (p = 0.325). The median (range) total volume of lymph collected by percutaneous aspirations was 207.5 (40-1050) mL in the study group and 505 (270-705) mL in the control group (p = 0.010). The incidence of seroma was similar in both groups (p = 0.845). The axillary drain was removed earlier in the study group than in controls (p = 0.046). The use of a BVSS offers marginal advantages when compared to the conventional technique.
