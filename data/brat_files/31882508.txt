Reducing Radiation Dermatitis Using a Film-forming Silicone Gel During Breast Radiotherapy: A Pilot Randomized-controlled Trial. To evaluate whether topical use of a film-forming silicone gel (StrataXRT®) could reduce radiation dermatitis compared to a moisturizing cream (X-derm®) in patients receiving whole breast radiotherapy. A total of 56 patients with breast cancer were randomized to use StrataXRT or X-derm. The severity of radiation dermatitis was graded using physiological skin parameters, clinician-assessed visual rating scales and patient-reported symptoms. Changes in these parameters from baseline to 4 weeks post-radiotherapy were evaluated every two weeks. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed different patterns of changes in the erythema index (F=3.609, p=0.008) and melanin index (F=3.475, p=0.015). The post hoc analysis demonstrated a significantly lower erythema index and melanin index in the patients allocated to the StrataXRT group. The use of StrataXRT can reduce radiation dermatitis with respect to objectively measured physiological skin parameters. The results of the present study will support the feasibility of conducting a larger randomized controlled trial.
