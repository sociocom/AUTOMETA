A randomised pilot of a self-help workbook intervention for breast cancer survivors. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a self-help workbook for improving adjustment for breast cancer survivors. An RCT compared the workbook (n = 20) with no-workbook controls (n = 20). Coping, traumatic stress and quality of life were measured at baseline, then 3 and 6 months later. No interactions were found. A significant group main effect was found for venting coping; controls used less venting coping than workbook participants (p = 0.034). A significant time main effect was obtained for cognitive functioning (p = 0.003). Reliable change indices showed a trend towards a protective effect across all coping measures for workbook participants compared to controls. Qualitative feedback suggested that participants felt well supported by the intervention, but would have preferred receiving it during treatment. While trends showed some promise for improving coping, endorsement for the workbook was not obtained. The difficulties encountered in recruiting survivors and the resulting implications regarding the feasibility of offering self-help resources to this population are discussed.
