A randomized trial of a telephone-delivered exercise intervention for non-urban dwelling women newly diagnosed with breast cancer: exercise for health. Physical activity is important following breast cancer. Trials of non-face-to-face interventions are needed to assist in reaching women living outside major metropolitan areas. This study seeks to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a telephone-delivered, mixed aerobic and resistance exercise intervention for non-urban Australian women with breast cancer. A randomized controlled trial comparing an 8-month intervention delivered by exercise physiologists (n = 73) to usual care (n = 70). Sixty-one percent recruitment rate and 96% retention at 12 months; 79% of women in the intervention group received at least 75% of calls; odds (OR, 95% CI) of meeting intervention targets favored the intervention group for resistance training (OR 3.2; 1.2, 8.9) and aerobic (OR 2.1; 0.8, 5.5) activity. Given the limited availability of physical activity programs for non-urban women with breast cancer, results provide strong support for feasibility and modest support for the efficacy of telephone-delivered interventions.
