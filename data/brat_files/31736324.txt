Increasing Adherence to Adjuvant Hormone Therapy Among Patients With Breast Cancer: A Smart Phone App-Based Pilot Study. This study tested the feasibility and efficacy of using a text-based intervention to increase initiation, decrease discontinuation, and improve adherence as prescribed to adjuvant hormone therapy (AHT) among hyphenate post-menopausal breast cancer survivors. The 3-month intervention consisted of daily text message reminders to take medication, coupled with a dynamic (eg, feedback on progress) tailored intervention using weekly interactive surveys delivered by a smartphone app. Five clinic sites within the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology participated. Hormone levels were measured prior to AHT initiation and at study exit. Of the 39 patients recruited to the pilot study, 27 (69.2%) completed all study requirements (completed both the baseline and the exit surveys, both blood draws, and did not miss more than 2 weekly surveys). Significant improvements were observed pre- to postintervention for self-reported medication adherence (P = .015), mental health functioning (P = .007), and perceived stress (P = .04). Significant decreases in estradiol, estrogen, and estrone hormone levels were observed from baseline to study exit (P < .001), indicating the accuracy of self-reported AHT adherence. Participants (91.9%) and physicians (100%) agreed that participant participation in the intervention was beneficial. The results of this pilot study established the general feasibility and efficacy of an app-based intervention to support patient AHT adherence. Larger controlled, randomized trials are needed to examine the effectiveness of the app-based intervention in improving AHT and quality of life among breast cancer survivors.
