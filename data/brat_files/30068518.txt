Can Dietary and Physical Activity Modifications Reduce Breast Density in Postmenopausal Women? The DAMA Study, a Randomized Intervention Trial in Italy. Few randomized trials have been carried out to evaluate the effect of lifestyle modifications on mammographic breast density (MBD). The randomized 2 Ã— 2 factorial Diet, physical Activity and MAmmography trial aimed to evaluate whether MBD can be reduced in postmenopausal women with high baseline MBD by a 24-month dietary and/or physical activity (PA) interventions. We randomized healthy postmenopausal women, attending the Florence (Italy) mammographic screening program, ages 50 to 69 years, nonsmokers, with MBD > 50% and no recent hormone therapy, to (i) a dietary intervention focused on plant foods, with a low glycemic load, low in saturated fats and alcohol; (ii) a PA intervention combining daily moderate intensity activities and one weekly supervised session of more strenuous activity; (iii) both interventions; (iv) general recommendations. We evaluated changes in MBD based on Volpara estimates comparing baseline and follow-up digital mammograms by an intention-to-treat-analysis. MBD measures were available for 226 participants. An interaction emerged between treatments and thus we run analyses by arms. A decrease in volumetric percent density emerged for women in the dietary intervention (ratio 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.97; P = 0.002) and in the PA intervention arm (0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98; P = 0.01) in comparison with controls. No clear effect emerged in the double intervention arm. This intervention trial suggests that a 24-month dietary or PA intervention may reduce MBD in postmenopausal women. A modification of dietary habits or an increase in PA in postmenopausal women may reduce MBD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings for planning breast cancer preventive strategies.
