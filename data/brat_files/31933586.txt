Emulsion of Olive Oil and Calcium Hydroxide for the Prevention of Radiation Dermatitis in Hypofractionation Post-Mastectomy Radiotherapy: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Most of the patients who have been treated by post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) experience skin toxicity. There have been few studies on acute radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients who received hypofractionation PMRT. 62 patients were randomized to receive a general skin care regimen with or without the addition of an emulsion of olive oil and calcium hydroxide twice a day, from the initiation of PMRT to 2 weeks after radiotherapy. Adverse skin reactions and the Skindex-16 score were assessed. At the 8th, 13th, and 16th fraction of PMRT, grade 1 dermatitis was found in 42, 90, and 90% of the control group and in 16, 30, and 71% of the intervention group. At the end of the study, the mean Skindex-16 score of the intervention group was significantly better than that of the control group (p = 0.019). Addition of an emulsion of olive oil and calcium hydroxide for patients undergoing hypofractionation PMRT yielded superior preventive results over a general skin care regimen alone, in terms of delaying skin toxicity, reducing the severity of acute radiation dermatitis, and a better quality of life in the intervention group. However, a larger number of patients will be required to confirm this result.
