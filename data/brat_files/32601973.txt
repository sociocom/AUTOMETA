Evaluation of the effect of N-acetylcysteine on the prevention and amelioration of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer patients: a randomized controlled study. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the incidence and severity of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) in breast cancer patients. A prospective randomized controlled open label study was conducted on 75 breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly for 12 weeks. Eligible patients were randomized to either the low dose group; 1200 mg daily NAC, the high dose group; 1200 mg NAC twice daily or the control group; received paclitaxel only. The primary endpoint was the incidence of different grades of PIPN using National Cancer Institute's common toxicity criteria for adverse event (NCI-CTCAE) while secondary endpoints were the severity of PIPN using modified total neuropathy score (mTNS), quality of life (QOL) using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTX) subscale, serum nerve growth factor (NGF), and serum malondialdehyde (MDA). At the end of the 12-week period, the incidence of grade (2, 3) peripheral neuropathy was significantly lower in the high dose group (28.6%) compared to the low dose group (61.9%) and the control group (100%), p value < 0.001. A significant improvement in the mTNS and QOL scores was observed after 6 and 12 weeks in the high dose group and the low dose group compared to the control, p value < 0.001. Significantly higher levels of serum NGF in the high dose group and lower level of serum MDA in the high dose and the low dose group were observed. Oral NAC (1200 mg once and twice daily) might reduce the incidence and severity of PIPN and improve the patients' QOL. Clinical Trial.gov registration number: NCT03492047.
