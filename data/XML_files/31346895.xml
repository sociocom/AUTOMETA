Randomized Controlled Trial to Reduce Bacterial Colonization of Surgical Drains with the Use of <intervention>Chlorhexidine-Coated Dressings</intervention> After Breast Cancer Surgery. Breast surgery is considered a clean surgery. However, surgical-site infection (SSI) rates are currently higher than predicted. Postoperative drains remain in situ for several days, with inevitable bacterial colonization and increased SSI risk. This randomized controlled trial <duration>from October 2016 to January 2018</duration> analyzed <eligibility>patients undergoing breast cancer surgery</eligibility>. The patients were randomized to either the <control>standard drain care group</control> or the antiseptic dressing group (3M® Tegaderm® CHG). Drain samples taken on postoperative days (PODs) 7 and 14 were cultured as standardized in the laboratory. <outcome-Measure>Colonization rates and SSI</outcome-Measure> were compared between the two groups. The study enrolled <No-of-participants>104</No-of-participants> patients with 167 surgical drains. The patients' clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups, with no statistically significant differences. <outcome>Bulb fluid cultures at postoperative week</outcome> (POW) 1 were positive for <control-value>42.9%</control-value> of the control group and <intervention-value>28.9%</intervention-value> of the antiseptic group (p = 0.06). <outcome>Cultures from the POW 2</outcome> assessment were positive for <control-value>79.7%</control-value> of the control group versus <intervention-value>54.9%</intervention-value> of the antiseptic group (p = 0.001). <outcome>Cultures from drain tubes</outcome> were positive for <control-value>79.8%</control-value> of the control group and <intervention-value>50.7%</intervention-value> of the antiseptic group (p = &lt; 0.001). In 11 patients, an <outcome>SSI developed</outcome>, <intervention-value>3</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>5.8%</intervention-value>) from the intervention and <control-value>8</control-value> (<control-value>15.4%</control-value>) from the control procedure (p = 0.11). The study findings demonstrated that the use of antiseptics at the drain exit site significantly reduced bacterial colonization of the closed drainage system in breast cancer surgery. Semi-permeable occlusive chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings provide an opportunity to test simple, safe, and low-cost interventions that may reduce drain bacterial colonization and SSI after breast surgery.
