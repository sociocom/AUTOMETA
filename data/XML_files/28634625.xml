Serum antioxidant capacity, biochemical profile and body composition of breast cancer survivors in a randomized <intervention>Mediterranean dietary</intervention> intervention study. Increasing evidence suggests that Mediterranean Diet (MD) is correlated with reduced risk of breast cancer (BC) and cancer mortality, since it modifies patients' serum antioxidant capacity, body composition and biochemical parameters. The aim of the study was to investigate whether a dietary intervention based on MD has a beneficial effect on these factors. In this intervention study, <No-of-participants>seventy</No-of-participants> <eligibility>female BC survivors</eligibility> were randomly assigned to (1) the intervention group (personalized dietary intervention based on MD) and (2) the <control>control group</control> (received the updated American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention and ad libitum diet). Both groups were assessed twice [beginning, end of study (after <duration>6Â months</duration>)] regarding their <outcome-Measure>anthropometric and biochemical parameters</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>serum vitamin C</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>vitamin A</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>a-tocopherol and CoQ10 levels</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>dietary intake</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>adherence to MD</outcome-Measure>. An additional intermediate analysis was conducted on participants' body composition and biochemical profile. Concerning the intervention group, <outcome>body weight, body fat mass, waist circumference, body mass index as well as HDL-cholesterol</outcome> were significantly decreased (P &lt;0.2%). An increase was observed in the <outcome>vitamin C levels</outcome> in blood (P &lt;0.2%). In the control group, <outcome>body weight, body fat mass and serum total cholesterol</outcome> rose (P &lt;0.2%). At the end of the study the two groups were significantly different considering <outcome>blood glucose, vitamin C, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin A and a-tocopherol levels</outcome>. This randomized dietary intervention based on MD managed to ameliorate serum antioxidant capacity, body composition, adherence to MD and glycemic profile of postmenopausal BC survivors.
