Effects of a green tea extract, <intervention>Polyphenon E</intervention>, on systemic biomarkers of growth factor signalling in women with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer. Observational and experimental data support a potential breast cancer chemopreventive effect of green tea. We conducted an ancillary study using archived blood/urine from a phase IB randomised, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial of an oral green tea extract, Polyphenon E (Poly E), in breast cancer patients. Using an adaptive trial design, <eligibility>women with stage I-III breast cancer who completed adjuvant treatment</eligibility> were randomised to Poly E 400 mg (n = <intervention-participants>16</intervention-participants>), 600 mg (n = <intervention-participants>11</intervention-participants>) and 800 mg (n = <intervention-participants>3</intervention-participants>) twice daily or matching <control>placebo</control> (n = <control-participants>10</control-participants>) for <duration>6 months</duration>. Blood and urine collection occurred at baseline, and at 2, 4 and 6 months. Biological endpoints included <outcome-Measure>growth factor [serum hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)]</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>lipid (serum cholesterol, triglycerides)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>oxidative damage</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>inflammatory biomarkers</outcome-Measure>. <duration>From July 2007-August 2009</duration>, <No-of-participants>40</No-of-participants> women were enrolled and <No-of-participants>34</No-of-participants> (<intervention-participants>26</intervention-participants> Poly E, <control-participants>eight</control-participants> placebo) were evaluable for biomarker endpoints. At 2 months, the Poly E group (all dose levels combined) compared to placebo had a significant decrease in <outcome>mean serum HGF levels</outcome> (-12.7% versus +6.3%, P = 0.04). This trend persisted at 4 and 6 months but was no longer statistically significant. For the Poly E group, <outcome>serum VEGF</outcome> decreased by 11.5% at 2 months (P = 0.02) and 13.9% at 4 months (P = 0.05) but did not differ compared to placebo. At 2 months, there was a trend toward a decrease in <outcome>serum cholesterol</outcome> with Poly E (P = 0.08). No significant differences were observed for other biomarkers. Our findings suggest potential mechanistic actions of tea polyphenols in growth factor signalling, angiogenesis and lipid metabolism.
