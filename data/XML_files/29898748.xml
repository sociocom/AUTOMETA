Effect of one <intervention>comprehensive education course</intervention> to lower <condition>anxiety</condition> and <condition>depression</condition> among <ethinicity>Chinese</ethinicity> <eligibility>breast cancer patients during the postoperative radiotherapy period</eligibility> - one randomized clinical trial. We investigated the effectiveness of one education course to lower the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms among breast cancer (BC) patients during radiotherapy (RT). All <No-of-participants>290</No-of-participants> <eligibility>one-sided BC patients</eligibility> were evenly randomized into intervention or <control>control arm</control>. "Intervention" patient was additionally provided with one three-hour course on psychological stresses and management skills. <outcome-Measure>Changes of anxiety and depression score and their 3-level severity category</outcome-Measure> ('normal', 'borderline' and 'abnormal' scored 0-7, 8-10 and 11-21, respectively) from HADS questionnaire over RT were evaluated by multivariable linear and ordinal logistic regressions. <outcome>Response rates</outcome> were <intervention-value>94</intervention-value> and <control-value>100%</control-value> by "intervention" and "control" arm, respectively. <outcome>Means of score changes</outcome> by "intervention" and "control" (n = 145) were + 0.59 (SD = 2.47) and + 0.11 (SD = 2.55) <outcome>for anxiety</outcome> and + 0.81 (SD = 2.81) and + 0.45 (SD = 2.77) <outcome>for depression scores</outcome>, respectively. <outcome>'Abnormal' anxiety and depression</outcome> patients were <control-value>4.1</control-value> and <control-value>6.9%</control-value> <outcome>at baseline</outcome> and <control-value>4.8</control-value> and <control-value>6.9%</control-value> <outcome>at end of RT</outcome> at 'control' arm; those rates were <intervention-value>6.6</intervention-value> and <intervention-value>7.4%</intervention-value>, and <intervention-value>8.8</intervention-value> and <intervention-value>10.3%</intervention-value> at 'intervention' arm, respectively. Both changes on anxiety and depression measurements between two arms were all insignificant (p > 0.20). One education course did not reduce the score and severity of anxiety and depression symptoms over RT period. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry #: ChiCTR-IIR-16008818 at www.chictr.org.cn .
