A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial of <intervention>Paravertebral</intervention> Block versus <control>General Anesthesia Alone</control> for Prosthetic Breast Reconstruction. Paravertebral blocks have gained popularity because of ease of implementation and a shift toward ambulatory breast surgery procedures. Previous retrospective studies have reported potential benefits of paravertebral blocks, including decreased narcotic and antiemetic use. The authors conducted a prospective controlled trial of <eligibility>patients undergoing breast reconstruction</eligibility> over a <duration>3-year</duration> period. The patients were randomized to either a study group of paravertebral blocks with general anesthesia or a control group of general anesthesia alone. Demographic and procedural data, in addition to data regarding <outcome-Measure>pain and nausea patient-reported numeric scores</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>consumption of opioid and antiemetic medications</outcome-Measure>, were recorded. A total of <No-of-participants>74</No-of-participants> patients were enrolled to either the paravertebral block (n = <intervention-participants>35</intervention-participants>) or the control group (n = <control-participants>39</control-participants>). There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, procedure type, or cancer diagnosis between the two groups. Patients who received a paravertebral block <outcome>required less opioid intraoperatively and postoperatively</outcome> combined compared with patients who did not receive paravertebral blocks (109 versus 246 fentanyl equivalent units; p &lt; 0.001), and reported significantly <outcome>lower pain scores</outcome> at 0 to 1 (3.0 versus 4.6; p = 0.02), 1 to 3 (2.0 versus 3.2; p = 0.01), and 3 to 6 (1.9 versus 2.7; p = 0.04) hours postoperatively. The study group also consumed <outcome>less antiemetic medication</outcome> (0.7 versus 2.1; p = 0.05). Incorporating paravertebral blocks carries considerable potential for improving pathways for breast cancer patients undergoing breast reconstruction--with minimal procedure-related morbidity. This is the first prospective study designed to assess paravertebral blocks in the setting of prosthetic breast reconstruction. Therapeutic, II.
