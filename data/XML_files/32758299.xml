EFFECT: a randomized phase II study of efficacy and impact on function of two doses of <intervention>nab-paclitaxel</intervention> as first-line treatment in <eligibility>older women with advanced breast cancer</eligibility>. Limited data are available regarding the use of nab-paclitaxel in older patients with breast cancer. A weekly schedule is recommended, but there is a paucity of evidence regarding the optimal dose. We evaluated the efficacy of two different doses of weekly nab-paclitaxel, with a specific focus on their corresponding impact on patient function, in order to address the lack of data specifically relating to the older population. EFFECT is an open-label, phase II trial wherein <No-of-participants>160</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with advanced breast cancer</eligibility> aged <average-age>≥ 65 years</average-age> were enrolled from 15 institutions within <location>Italy</location>. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 (arm A) or 125 mg/m2 (arm B) on days 1, 8, and 15 on a 28-day cycle, as first-line treatment for advanced disease. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>event-free survival (EFS)</outcome-Measure>, wherein an event was defined as disease progression (PD), functional decline (FD), or death. In each arm, the null hypothesis that the median EFS would be ≤ 7 months was tested against a one-sided alternative according to the Brookmeyer Crowley test. Secondary endpoints included <outcome-Measure>objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety</outcome-Measure>. After a median follow-up of 32.6 months, 140 events were observed in <No-of-participants>158</No-of-participants> evaluable patients. <outcome>Median EFS</outcome> was 8.2 months (90% CI, 5.9-8.9; p = 0.188) in arm A vs 8.3 months (90% CI, 6.2-9.7, p = 0.078) in arm B. <outcome>Progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rates were similar</outcome> in both groups. A higher <outcome>percentage of dose reductions and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs)</outcome> was noted in arm B. The most frequently reported non-haematological AEs were <outcome>fatigue (grade [G] 2-3 toxicity occurrence</outcome> in arm A vs B, <intervention-value>43%</intervention-value> and <control-value>51%</control-value>, respectively) and <outcome>peripheral neuropathy</outcome> (G2-3 arm A vs B, <intervention-value>19%</intervention-value> and <control-value>38%</control-value>, respectively). Pre-specified outcomes were similar in both treatment arms. However, 100 mg/m2 was significantly better tolerated with fewer neurotoxicity-related events, representing a more feasible dose to be recommended for older patients with advanced disease.
