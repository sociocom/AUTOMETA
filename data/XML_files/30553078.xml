Design of a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of a <intervention>reproductive health survivorship care plan</intervention> in young breast cancer survivors. Young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) have unmet needs for managing hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, sexual health, and contraception. Describe the design and participant characteristics of a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of the survivorship care plan on reproductive health (SCP-R) intervention on improving hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, sexual health, and contraception in YBCS. SCP-R is a web-based intervention with text message support encompassing evidence- based practices on four reproductive health issues. <eligibility>YBCS with â‰¥1 reproductive health issue</eligibility> are randomized to intervention (full SCP-R access) or attention control (access to list of online resources) arms with <duration>24-week</duration> follow-up. The primary outcome will be <outcome-Measure>improvement of at least one reproductive health issue</outcome-Measure> measured by validated self-report instruments. Each YBCS nominated one healthcare provider (HCP), who can access the same materials as their patient. HCP outcomes are preparedness and confidence in discussing each issue. Among <No-of-participants>318</No-of-participants> YBCS screened, 57.2% underwent randomization. Mean age was <average-age>40.0 (SD 5.9)</average-age>, and mean age at cancer diagnosis was 35.6 (SD 5.4). <outcome>Significant hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, vaginal symptoms, and inadequate contraception</outcome> were reported by <intervention-value>50.5%</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>50%</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>46.7%</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>62.1%</intervention-value> of YBCS, respectively; <intervention-value>70.9%</intervention-value> had <outcome>multiple issues</outcome>. Among <No-of-participants>165</No-of-participants> nominated HCPs, 32.7% enrolled. The majority of HCPs reported <outcome>preparedness</outcome> (68.5-90.7%) and <outcome>confidence</outcome> (50.0-74.1%) in discussing reproductive health issues with YBCS. HCPs were least likely to report preparedness or confidence in discussing fertility-related concerns. Conducting a trial for improving YBCS reproductive health online is feasible, providing a mechanism to disseminate evidence-based management.
