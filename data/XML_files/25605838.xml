CEREBEL (EGF111438): A Phase III, Randomized, Open-Label Study of <intervention>Lapatinib Plus Capecitabine</intervention> Versus <control>Trastuzumab Plus Capecitabine</control> in <eligibility>Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</eligibility>. CEREBEL compared the incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving lapatinib-capecitabine or trastuzumab-capecitabine. <eligibility>Patients without baseline CNS metastases</eligibility> were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive lapatinib-capecitabine (lapatinib 1,250 mg per day; capecitabine 2,000 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 to 14 every 21 days) or trastuzumab-capecitabine (trastuzumab loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks; capecitabine 2,500 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 to 14 every 21 days). The primary end point was <outcome-Measure>incidence of CNS metastases</outcome-Measure> as first site of relapse. Secondary end points included <outcome-Measure>progression-free survival (PFS)</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>overall survival (OS)</outcome-Measure>. The study was terminated early with <No-of-participants>540</No-of-participants> enrolled patients (<intervention-participants>271</intervention-participants> received lapatinib-capecitabine, and <control-participants>269</control-participants> received trastuzumab-capecitabine). <outcome>Incidence of CNS metastases</outcome> as first site of relapse was <intervention-value>3%</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>eight</intervention-value> of <intervention-participants>251</intervention-participants> patients) for lapatinib-capecitabine and <control-value>5%</control-value> (<control-value>12</control-value> of <control-participants>250</control-participants> patients) for trastuzumab-capecitabine (treatment differences, -1.6%; 95% CI, -2% to 5%; P = .360). <outcome>PFS and OS</outcome> were longer with trastuzumab-capecitabine versus lapatinib-capecitabine (hazard ratio [HR] for PFS, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.64; HR for OS, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.64). <outcome>Serious adverse events</outcome> were reported in <intervention-value>13%</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>34</intervention-value> of <intervention-participants>269</intervention-participants> patients) and <control-value>17%</control-value> (<control-value>45</control-value> of <control-participants>267</control-participants> patients) of patients in the lapatinib-capecitabine and trastuzumab-capecitabine arms, respectively. CEREBEL is inconclusive for the primary end point, and no difference was detected between lapatinb-capecitabine and trastuzumab-capecitabine for the incidence of CNS metastases. A better outcome was observed with trastuzumab-capecitabine in the overall population. However, lapatinib-capecitabine efficacy may have been affected by previous exposure to a trastuzumab regimen and/or when treatment was given as first- or second-line therapy in the metastatic setting.
