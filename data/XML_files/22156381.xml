The protective effect of <intervention>zoledronic acid</intervention> on <condition>bone loss</condition> in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer treated with sequential tamoxifen and letrozole: a prospective, randomized, phase II trial. This study reports the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid (ZOL) in preventing bone loss in postmenopausal patients receiving an aromatase inhibitor (AI) following tamoxifen. <eligibility>Postmenopausal patients with stage I-III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who received tamoxifen for 2.5-3 years</eligibility> were randomized to receive <intervention>letrozole</intervention> (2.5 mg/day) with (n = <intervention-participants>47</intervention-participants>) or <control>without</control> (n = <control-participants>43</control-participants>) ZOL (4 mg i.v. every 6 months) for <duration>2 years</duration>. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>percent change from baseline in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD)</outcome-Measure> up to 60 months. <No-of-participants>Ninety</No-of-participants> patients (<No-of-participants>86</No-of-participants> evaluable) with a median age of <average-age>59 years (42.9-83.6)</average-age>, 50/86 of whom had previously been treated with chemotherapy, were followed for a median time of 41.4 months. While the control group showed a significant decrease in <outcome>LS T-score</outcome> (p = 0.0005), the ZOL group presented an increase over time (p = 0.0143). <outcome>Change over time in LS T-score</outcome> was significantly different between groups, favoring ZOL (p &lt; 0.0001 at 24 and 48 months). <outcome>No fractures, renal dysfunction or osteonecrosis of the jaw</outcome> were reported. The <outcome>toxicity profile</outcome> was similar to those previously reported for each drug. The addition of ZOL to letrozole was safe and efficacious in maintaining LS BMD in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and who were receiving letrozole following 2.5-3 years of tamoxifen.
