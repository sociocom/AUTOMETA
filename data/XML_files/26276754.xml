Effect of <intervention>Metformin</intervention> on Breast Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Proliferation in a Randomized Presurgical Trial. Metformin is associated with lower breast cancer risk in epidemiologic studies and showed decreased proliferation in HER2-positive breast cancer in a presurgical trial. To provide insight into its preventive potential, we measured proliferation by Ki-67 labeling index (LI) of intraepithelial lesions surrounding breast cancer. We randomly assigned <No-of-participants>200</No-of-participants> <eligibility>nondiabetic patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer</eligibility> in core biopsies to metformin, 1,700 mg or <control>placebo</control> once daily for 28 days before surgery. Upon surgery, five to seven specimens of cancer adjacent (â‰¤1 cm) and distant (>1 cm) tissue were screened for <outcome-Measure>LCIS</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>ductal hyperplasia (DH)</outcome-Measure>. The prevalence of LCIS, DCIS, and DH was 4.5% (9/200), 67% (133/200), and 35% (69/200), respectively. Overall, metformin did not affect Ki-67 LI in premalignant disorders. The <outcome>median posttreatment Ki-67 LI</outcome> (IQR) in the metformin and placebo arm was, respectively, <intervention-value>15%</intervention-value> (5-15) versus <control-value>5%</control-value> (4-6) <outcome>in LCIS</outcome> (P = 0.1), <intervention-value>12%</intervention-value> (8-20) versus <control-value>10%</control-value> (7-24) <outcome>in DCIS</outcome> (P = 0.9), and <intervention-value>3%</intervention-value> (1-4) versus <control-value>3%</control-value> (1-4) <outcome>in DH</outcome> (P = 0.5). However, <outcome>posttreatment Ki-67 in HER2-positive DCIS lesions</outcome> was significantly lower in women randomized to metformin especially when ER was coexpressed: <intervention-value>22%</intervention-value> (11-32) versus <control-value>35%</control-value> (30-40) <outcome>in HER2-positive DCIS</outcome> (n = 22, P = .06); <intervention-value>12%</intervention-value> (7-18) versus <control-value>32%</control-value> (27-42) <outcome>in ER-positive/HER2-positive DCIS</outcome> (n = 15, P = .004). Eight of 22 (36%) HER2-positive DCIS were adjacent to HER2-negative <outcome>invasive breast cancer</outcome>. In tissue samples obtained following 4 weeks of study drug, proliferation was lower in HER2-positive DCIS for women randomized to metformin versus placebo. An adjuvant trial incorporating metformin in HER2-positive DCIS is warranted.
