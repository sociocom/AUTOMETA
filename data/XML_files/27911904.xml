<intervention>Dressing Wear Time</intervention> after Breast Reconstruction: A Randomized Clinical Trial. The evidence to support dressing standards for breast surgery wounds is empiric and scarce. This two-arm randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the effect of dressing wear time on surgical site infection (SSI) rates, skin colonization and patient perceptions. A total of <No-of-participants>200</No-of-participants> <eligibility>breast cancer patients undergoing breast reconstruction</eligibility> were prospectively enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated to group I (dressing removed on the first postoperative day, n = <intervention-participants>100</intervention-participants>) or group II (dressing removed on the sixth postoperative day, n = <intervention-participants>100</intervention-participants>). SSIs were defined and classified according to criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Samples collected before placing the dressing and after 1 day (group I) and 6 days (both groups) were cultured for skin colonization assessments. <outcome-Measure>Patients preferences and perceptions with regard to safety, comfort and convenience</outcome-Measure> were recorded and analyzed. A total of <No-of-participants>186</No-of-participants> patients completed the follow-up. The global <outcome>SSI rate</outcome> was 4.5%. <intervention-value>Six</intervention-value> patients in group I and <intervention-value>three</intervention-value> in group II had <outcome>SSI</outcome> (p = 0.497). Before dressing, the groups were similar with regard to skin colonization. At the sixth day, there was a higher <outcome>colonization by coagulase-negative staphylococci</outcome> in group I (p&lt;.0001). Patients preferred to keep dressing for six days (p&lt;.0001), and considered this a safer choice (p&lt;.05). Despite group I had a higher skin colonization by coagulase-negative staphylococci on the sixth postoperative day, there was no difference in SSI rates. Patients preferred keeping dressing for six days and considered it a safer choice. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01148823.
