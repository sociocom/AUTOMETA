<intervention>Nigella sativa L.</intervention> for prevention of <condition>acute radiation dermatitis</condition> in breast cancer: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Nigella sativa L. (N. sativa) extract on preventing the incidence of acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) in breast cancer patients. <No-of-participants>Sixty-two</No-of-participants> <eligibility>breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT)</eligibility> were randomly assigned to receiveN. sativa 5% gel or <control>placebo</control>. Patients were instructed to apply the medications twice daily during RT period. The severity of ARD, the <outcome-Measure>incidence of moist desquamation, worst experienced pain, and skin-related quality of life (SRQOL) scores</outcome-Measure> were assessed weekly during RT. Patients who were treated with the N. sativa gel <outcome>developed ARD</outcome> significantly less frequently compared to those who used the placebo (p &lt; 0.05 for all weeks except week 2, p = 0.36). The <outcome>incidence time of grade 2 and 3 of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) toxicity</outcome> was prolonged significantly with N. sativa gel as compared to placebo (35 vs. 29 days, p = 0.00 and 42 vs. 40 days, p = 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, the <outcome>occurrence of moist desquamation</outcome> was delayed in the N. sativa gel group compared with the placebo group (37 vs. 33 days, p = 0.01). The <outcome>mean score of the worst pain</outcome> that patients experienced in the placebo group was significantly higher than that of the N. sativa gel group at week 3 (2.5 ± 0.5 vs. 1.2 ± 0.3, p &lt; 0.05). Nonetheless, the application of N. sativa gel had no significant <outcome>effect on the SRQOL</outcome> of patients at any week. N. sativa extract significantly decreases the severity of ARD and delays the onset of moist desquamation in breast cancer patients.
