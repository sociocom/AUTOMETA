<intervention>Expressive writing</intervention> in early breast cancer survivors. This article is the report of a study aimed at determining whether or not expressive writing improves the quality-of-life of <eligibility>early breast cancer survivors</eligibility>. An additional aim is the investigation of whether or not the type of writing prompt makes a difference in results. The risk of distress can extend well beyond the time of a breast cancer diagnosis. Emotional expression may assist in dealing with this. Randomized controlled study. Participants (n = <No-of-participants>120</No-of-participants>) were randomized into one of four groups: a <control>control group (no writing)</control> or one of three expressive writing groups: breast cancer trauma, any self-selected trauma and facts related to breast cancer. Participants wrote 20 minutes a day for <duration>4 consecutive days</duration>. Their <outcome-Measure>quality-of-life</outcome-Measure> was measured, using the 'Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer Version', at baseline and at 1 month and 6 months after writing. Paired t-tests, multivariate analysis of variance and multiple regression were used to analyse the data of the <No-of-participants>97</No-of-participants> participants who completed the journaling assignment and at least the first assessment, collected in 2006. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. Expressive writing about one's breast cancer, breast cancer trauma and facts related to breast cancer, significantly <outcome>improved the quality-of-life outcome</outcome>. Expressive writing, focusing the instructions on writing about one's living and dealing with a diagnosis of breast cancer, is recommended for early breast cancer survivors as a feasible and easily implemented treatment approach to improve quality-of-life.
