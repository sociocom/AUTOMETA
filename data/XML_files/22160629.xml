A randomized trial of <intervention>exercise</intervention> on well-being and function following breast cancer surgery: the RESTORE trial. This study aimed to determine the effect of a moderate, tailored exercise program on health-related quality of life, physical function, and arm volume in women receiving treatment for nonmetastatic breast cancer. <eligibility>Women who were within 4-12 weeks of surgery for stage I-III breast cancer</eligibility> were randomized to center-based <intervention>exercise</intervention> and l<intervention>ymphedema education</intervention> intervention or <control>patient education</control>. Functional assessment of <outcome-Measure>cancer therapy-breast cancer (FACT-B)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>6-min walk</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>arm volume</outcome-Measure> were performed at 3-month intervals through <duration>18 months</duration>. Repeated measures analysis of covariance was used to model the total meters walked over time, FACT-B scores, and arm volume. Models were adjusted for baseline measurement, baseline affected arm volume, number of nodes removed, age, self-reported symptoms, baseline SF-12 mental and physical component scores, visit, and treatment group. Of the recruited <No-of-participants>104</No-of-participants> women, <No-of-participants>82</No-of-participants> completed all 18 months. Mean age (range) was <average-age>53.6 (32-82) years</average-age>; 88% were <ethinicity>Caucasian</ethinicity>; 45% were employed full time; 44% were overweight; and 28% obese. Approximately, 46% had breast-conserving surgery; 79% had axillary node dissection; 59% received chemotherapy; and 64% received radiation. The intervention resulted in an average increase of 34.3 ml (SD = 12.8) versus patient education (p = 0.01). <outcome>Changes in FACT-B scores and arm volumes</outcome> were not significantly different. With this early exercise intervention after breast cancer diagnosis, a significant improvement was achieved in <outcome>physical function</outcome>, with no decline in health-related quality of life or detrimental effect on arm volume. Starting a supervised exercise regimen that is tailored to an individual's strength and stamina within 3 months following breast cancer surgery appears safe and may hasten improvements in physical functioning.
