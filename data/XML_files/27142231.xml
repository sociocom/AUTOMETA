The Influence of <intervention>Spiritual Framing</intervention> on <ethinicity>African American</ethinicity> Women's Mammography Intentions: A Randomized Trial. Spiritual framing of breast cancer communication may provide a useful strategy for addressing disparate rates of breast cancer mortality among African American women. The efficacy of a spiritually framed breast cancer screening (BCS) message was compared with that of a <control>traditional BCS message</control>. Specifically, <No-of-participants>200</No-of-participants> <eligibility>African American women</eligibility> were randomly assigned to review either a spiritually framed or traditional BCS message and complete a self-administered survey, including a thought-listing form. Message efficacy was measured by <outcome-Measure>number of thoughts generated (elaboration)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>ratio of positive to negative thoughts (polarity)</outcome-Measure>, and <intervention>intention to obtain and/or recommend a mammogram</intervention>. Multiple linear regression and structural equation modeling were used to assess direct and indirect (mediated) associations among variables. Spiritual framing was positively associated with <outcome>greater elaboration</outcome> (β = .265, SE = .36, p &lt; .001) and more <outcome>positive polarity</outcome> (β = .237, SE = .04, p &lt; .001) . Spiritual framing also had a significant indirect <outcome>effect on mammography intentions through polarity</outcome> (standardized indirect effect = .057, 95% confidence interval [.024, .106], p &lt; .001). These results indicate that spiritual framing may improve the efficacy of BCS messages among African American women by eliciting more positive thoughts about screening. Interventions targeting African American women might consider the role of spirituality when tailoring messages to encourage regular mammography use.
