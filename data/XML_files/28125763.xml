Continued Treatment Effect of <intervention>Zoledronic Acid</intervention> Dosing Every 12 vs 4 Weeks in Women With Breast Cancer Metastatic to Bone: The OPTIMIZE-2 Randomized Clinical Trial. Zoledronic acid, a potent bisphosphonate, is commonly administered to patients with bone metastases to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs). However, there have been concerns regarding its long-term monthly administration. To examine whether zoledronic acid every 12 weeks was noninferior to zoledronic acid every 4 weeks in <eligibility>patients with metastatic breast cancer that involved the bone who had previously received a standard dosing regimen of zoledronic acid and/or pamidronate disodium</eligibility>. OPTIMIZE-2 was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 3 trial of intention-to-treat (full analysis set), evaluable (per protocol), and safety populations. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive 4.0 mg of intravenous zoledronic acid every 4 or every 12 weeks with <control>placebo</control> for interim infusions for 1 year. The study was conducted at 102 clinical trial centers in the <location>United States</location> from <duration>March 3, 2006, to July 25, 2013</duration>. Data analysis was performed from October 7, 2013, to March 24, 2014. The study randomized <No-of-participants>416</No-of-participants> women (<average-age>≥18 years</average-age> old) with bone metastases from breast cancer who previously received 9 or more doses of zoledronic acid and/or pamidronate during the first 10 to 15 months of therapy. The primary end point was the <outcome-Measure>proportion of patients with 1 or more SRE on study (SRE rate)</outcome-Measure>. The key secondary end points included <outcome-Measure>time to first SRE</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>skeletal morbidity rate (SMR)</outcome-Measure>. A total of <No-of-participants>416</No-of-participants> women were randomized: <intervention-participants>200</intervention-participants> patients received zoledronic acid every 4 weeks (mean [SD] age, 59.2 [11.1] years; 173 were <ethinicity>white</ethinicity> [86.5%]), <intervention-participants>203</intervention-participants> patients received zoledronic acid every 12 weeks (mean [SD] age, 58.6 [11.2] years; 178 were <ethinicity>white</ethinicity> [87.7%]), and <control-participants>13</control-participants> patients received placebo (mean [SD] age, 60.8 [12.2] years; 13 were <ethinicity>white</ethinicity> [100%]). Baseline characteristics were similar in both zoledronic acid treatment arms. After 1 year of follow-up, <outcome>SREs</outcome> occurred in <control-value>44</control-value> patients (<control-value>22.0%</control-value>) in the zoledronic acid every 4 weeks group and <intervention-value>47</intervention-value> patients (<intervention-value>23.2%</intervention-value>) in the zoledronic acid every 12 weeks group (proportional difference of -1.2%; 1-sided 97.5% CI bound of the difference in SRE rate between arms, -9.8%; noninferiority P = .02). The <outcome>time to first SRE</outcome> between treatment groups was not statistically significantly different (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.70-1.60; P = .79). The <outcome>mean (SD) SMR</outcome> was 0.46 (1.06) vs 0.50 (1.50) events per year in the every 4 weeks vs every 12 weeks groups (P = .85). The <outcome>safety profiles</outcome> of the every 4 weeks and every 12 weeks groups were comparable, with <control-value>189</control-value> patients (<control-value>95.5%</control-value>) in the every 4 weeks group having at least 1 adverse event compared with <intervention-value>189</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>93.5%</intervention-value>) in the every 12 weeks group. The every 12 weeks regimen of zoledronic acid was noninferior to the every 4 weeks regimen for the proportion of patients experiencing 1 or more SRE. These results may have a substantial influence on current clinical practice for treatment of patients with bone metastasis from breast cancer. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00320710.
