Safety and efficacy of alternating treatment with <intervention>EP2006</intervention>, a filgrastim biosimilar, and <control>reference filgrastim</control>: a phase III, randomised, double-blind clinical study in the prevention of <condition>severe neutropenia</condition> in <eligibility>patients with breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy</eligibility>. In 2015, the biosimilar filgrastim EP2006 became the first biosimilar approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for commercial use in the United States, marketed as Zarxio® (Sandoz). This phase III randomised, double-blind registration study in <eligibility>patients with breast cancer receiving (neo)adjuvant myelosuppressive chemotherapy (TAC; docetaxel + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide)</eligibility> compares reference filgrastim, Neupogen® (Amgen), with two groups receiving alternating treatment with reference and biosimilar every other cycle. A total of <No-of-participants>218</No-of-participants> patients receiving 5 µg/kg/day filgrastim over six chemotherapy cycles were randomised 1: 1: 1: 1 into four arms. Two arms received only one product, biosimilar or reference (unswitched), and two arms (switched) received alternating treatments every other cycle (biosimilar then reference or vice versa over six cycles). Since the switch occurred from cycle 2 onwards, this analysis compared pooled switched groups to the unswitched reference group for efficacy during cycles 2-6. Safety was also assessed. Non-inferiority in <outcome-Measure>febrile neutropenia (FN) rates</outcome-Measure> between groups for cycles 2-6 was shown if 95% were within a pre-defined margin of - 15%. A total of <intervention-participants>109</intervention-participants> patients switched treatment, and <control-participants>52</control-participants> patients received reference in all cycles. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The <outcome>incidence of FN</outcome> was <control-value>0%</control-value> (reference) versus <intervention-value>3.4%</intervention-value> (n = <intervention-value>3</intervention-value>, switched) across cycles 2-6, with a difference of - 3.4% (95% confidence interval: -9.65% to 4.96%), showing non-inferiority. <outcome>Infections</outcome> occurred in <intervention-value>9.3%</intervention-value> (switched) versus <control-value>9.9%</control-value> (reference). <outcome>Hospitalisation due to FN</outcome> was low (<intervention-value>one</intervention-value> patient in cycle 6; switched). <outcome>Adverse events</outcome> related to filgrastim were reported in <intervention-value>42.1%</intervention-value> (switched) versus <control-value>39.2%</control-value> (reference) (all cycles). <outcome>Musculoskeletal/connective tissue disorders</outcome> related to filgrastim occurred in <intervention-value>35.5%</intervention-value> (switched) versus <control-value>39.2%</control-value> (reference) (all cycles), including bone pain (30.8% versus 33.3%). No <outcome>neutralising antibodies</outcome> were detected. There were no clinically meaningful results regarding efficacy, safety or immunogenicity when switching from reference to biosimilar filgrastim/EP2006, or vice versa.
