<intervention>Internet-based physical activity</intervention> intervention for women with a family history of breast cancer. Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer. Physical activity interventions that can be delivered through the Internet have the potential to increase participant reach. The efficacy of an Internet-based physical activity intervention was tested in a sample of women at an elevated risk for breast cancer. A total of <No-of-participants>55</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with at least 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer (but no personal history of breast cancer)</eligibility> were randomized to a <duration>3-month</duration> theoretically grounded Internet-based physical activity intervention or an <control>active control arm</control>. <outcome-Measure>Minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>psychosocial mediators of physical activity adoption and maintenance</outcome-Measure>, as well as <outcome-Measure>worry and perceived risk of developing breast cancer</outcome-Measure> were assessed at baseline, 3-month, and 5-month follow up. Participants were on average <average-age>46.2 (SD = 11.4) years</average-age> old with a body mass index of 27.3 (SD = 4.8) kg/m2. The intervention arm significantly <outcome>increased minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity</outcome> compared to the active control arm at 3 months (213 vs. 129 min/week) and 5 months (208 vs. 119 min/week; both ps &lt; .001). Regression models indicated that participants in the intervention had significantly <outcome>higher self-efficacy for physical activity at 3 months</outcome> (p &lt; .01) and borderline significantly <outcome>higher self-efficacy at 5 months</outcome> (p = .05). <outcome>Baseline breast cancer worry</outcome> and <outcome>perceived risk</outcome> were not associated with physical activity. Findings from this study suggest that an Internet-based physical activity intervention may substantially increase physical activity in women with a family history of breast cancer.
