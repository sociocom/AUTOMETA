The effect of an <intervention>aerobic exercise</intervention> bout 24 h prior to each doxorubicin treatment for breast cancer on markers of <condition>cardiotoxicity</condition> and treatment symptoms: a RCT. In rodents, a single exercise bout performed 24 h prior to a single doxorubicin treatment provides cardio-protection. This study investigated whether performing this intervention prior to every doxorubicin treatment for breast cancer reduced subclinical cardiotoxicity and treatment symptoms. <No-of-participants>Twenty-four</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with early stage breast cancer</eligibility> were randomly assigned to perform a 30-min, vigorous-intensity treadmill bout 24 h prior to each of four doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy treatments or to <control>usual care</control>. Established <outcome-Measure>echocardiographic and circulating biomarkers of subclinical cardiotoxicity</outcome-Measure>, as well as <outcome-Measure>blood pressure and body weight</outcome-Measure> were measured before the first and 7-14 days after the last treatment. The Rotterdam symptom checklist was used to assess patient-reported symptoms. The exercise and usual care groups did not differ in the <outcome>doxorubicin-related change in longitudinal strain, twist, or cardiac troponin</outcome>. However, the four total exercise bouts prevented <outcome>changes in hemodynamics</outcome> (increased cardiac output, resting heart rate, decreased systemic vascular resistance, p &lt; 0.01) and <outcome>reduced body weight gain, prevalence of depressed mood, sore muscles, and low back pain</outcome> after the last treatment (p &lt; 0.05) relative to the usual care group. <outcome>No adverse events</outcome> occurred. An exercise bout performed 24 h prior to every doxorubicin treatment did not have an effect on markers of subclinical cardiotoxicity, but had a positive systemic effect on hemodynamics, musculoskeletal symptoms, mood, and body weight in women with breast cancer. A single exercise bout prior to chemotherapy treatments may be a simple clinical modality to reduce symptoms and weight gain among women with breast cancer.
