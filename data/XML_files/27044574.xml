Dead space closure with <intervention>quilting suture</intervention> versus <control>conventional closure</control> with drainage for the prevention of <condition>seroma</condition> after mastectomy for breast cancer (QUISERMAS): protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Postoperative wound seroma is common after mastectomy. This complication is associated with significant impact on patient outcomes and healthcare costs. The optimal closure approach for seroma prevention remains unknown but some evidence suggests that quilting suture of the dead space could lower the incidence of seroma. The aim of this trial is to compare seroma formation using quilting suture versus conventional closure with drainage in <eligibility>patients undergoing mastectomy</eligibility>. This is a multicentre, superiority, randomised controlled trial in <eligibility>women undergoing mastectomy with or without axillary involvement</eligibility>. Exclusion criteria include indication of bilateral mastectomy or immediate reconstruction and any physical or psychiatric condition that could impair patient's ability to cooperate with postoperative data collection or that do not allow an informed consent. <No-of-participants>320</No-of-participants> participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either quilting suture or conventional wound closure with drain. The primary outcome is <outcome-Measure>seroma requiring either aspiration or surgical intervention within 21 days following mastectomy</outcome-Measure>. Secondary outcomes include <outcome-Measure>seroma regardless of whether or not it requires an intervention</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>surgical site infection</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>pain score</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>cosmetic result</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>patient's quality of life</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>costs</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>cost-effectiveness</outcome-Measure>. The primary analysis will be an intention-to treat analysis performed with a χ(2) test (or Fisher's exact test). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. This study was approved by Tours Research ethics committee (CPP TOURS-Region Centre-Ouest 1, 2014-R20, 16 December 2014). Study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant national and international breast cancer conferences. NCT02263651.
