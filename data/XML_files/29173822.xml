The effectiveness of a clinical and home-based <intervention>physical activity</intervention> program and <intervention>simple lymphatic drainage</intervention> in the prevention of <condition>breast cancer-related lymphedema</condition>: A prospective randomized controlled study. To investigate the effectiveness of a clinical and home-based, nurse-led physical activity program (PAP) and simple lymphatic drainage (SLD) in the prevention of breast cancer-related lymphedema. A total of <No-of-participants>52</No-of-participants> breast cancer patients were randomized to either a PAP and SLD program (n = <intervention-participants>25</intervention-participants>) or a <control>control group</control> (n = <control-participants>27</control-participants>). Patients in both groups were also provided training for lymphedema. The PAP and SLD were administered through home visits by the investigators, twice a week for <duration>six weeks</duration>, in the intervention group. The control group did not undergo intervention. The <outcome-Measure>circumference of the upper extremity</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>symptom severity</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>physical function</outcome-Measure> were measured in both groups. The <outcome>upper extremity circumference</outcome> increased by about two times from the baseline, in the control group, especially in the sixth week (p &lt; 0.05). <outcome>Lymphedema-related symptom severity scores</outcome> were found to decrease significantly in the intervention group, compared to those at the baseline (p &lt; 0.05). It was recommended that PAP and SLD, with a follow-up program, be used for patients who planned to undergo breast cancer surgery, starting from before surgery and continuing until after, to prevent breast cancer-related lymphedema.
