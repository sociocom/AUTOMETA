Lower rate-pressure product during submaximal walking: a link to fatigue improvement following a physical activity intervention among breast cancer survivors. Research showing a link between exercise-induced changes in aerobic fitness and reduced fatigue after a cancer diagnosis has been inconsistent. We evaluated associations of fatigue and rate-pressure product (RPP), a reliable index of myocardial oxygen demand, at rest and during submaximal walking following a physical activity intervention among <eligibility>post-primary treatment breast cancer survivors (BCS)</eligibility>. Secondary analyses of <No-of-participants>152</No-of-participants> BCS in a randomized controlled trial testing a <intervention>physical activity</intervention> intervention (INT) versus <control>usual care (UC)</control> were performed. The INT group completed counseling/group discussions along with supervised exercise sessions tapered to unsupervised exercise. Evaluations were made at baseline and immediately post-intervention (M3) on <outcome-Measure>measures of physical activity (accelerometry)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>graded walk test</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>average fatigue over the previous 7 days</outcome-Measure>. RPP was calculated by dividing the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure by 100. <outcome>Resting and submaximal RPPs</outcome> were significantly improved in both groups at M3; however, the magnitude of change (∆) was greater in the INT group from stage 1 (∆RPP1; INT -13 ± 17 vs. UC -7 ± 18; p = 0.03) through stage 4 (∆RPP4; INT -21 ± 26 vs. UC -9 ± 24; p &lt; 0.01) of the walk test. The INT group reported significantly <outcome>reduced fatigue</outcome> (INT -0.7 ± 2.0 vs. UC +0.1 ± 2.0; p = 0.02) which was positively associated with ∆RPP during stages 2-4 of the walk test but not ∆aerobic fitness. Lower RPP during submaximal walking was significantly associated with reduced fatigue in BCS. Exercise/physical activity training programs that lower the physiological strain during submaximal walking may produce the largest improvements in reported fatigue.
