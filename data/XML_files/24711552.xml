Quality of life in MAP.3 (Mammary Prevention 3): a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating <intervention>exemestane</intervention> for prevention of breast cancer. Exemestane, a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, <outcome>reduced invasive breast cancer incidence</outcome> by <intervention-value>65%</intervention-value> among <No-of-participants>4,560</No-of-participants> postmenopausal women randomly assigned to exemestane (25 mg per day) compared with <control>placebo</control> in the National Cancer Institute of <location>Canada</location> (NCIC) Clinical Trials Group MAP.3 (Mammary Prevention 3) trial, but effects on quality of life (QOL) were not fully described. <outcome-Measure>Menopause-specific and health-related QOL</outcome-Measure> were assessed by using the four Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) domains and the eight Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scales at baseline, 6 months, and yearly thereafter. MENQOL questionnaire completion was high (88% to 98%) in both groups at each follow-up visit. Change scores for each MENQOL and SF-36 scale, calculated at each assessment time relative to baseline, were compared by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Clinically important worsened QOL was defined as a MENQOL change score increase of more than 0.5 (of 8) points and an SF-36 change score decrease of more than 5 (of 100) points from baseline. Exemestane had small negative effects on women's <outcome>self-reported vasomotor symptoms, sexual symptoms, and pain</outcome>, which occurred mainly in the first 6 months to 2 years after random assignment. However, these changes represented only a small excess number of women being given exemestane with clinically important <outcome>worsening of QOL</outcome> at one time or another; specifically, <intervention-value>8%</intervention-value> more in the vasomotor domain and <intervention-value>4%</intervention-value> more each in the sexual domain and for pain. No other between-group differences were observed. Overall, slightly more women in the exemestane arm (<intervention-value>32%</intervention-value>) than in the placebo arm (<control-value>28%</control-value>) <outcome>discontinued</outcome> assigned treatment. Exemestane given for prevention has limited negative impact on menopause-specific and health-related QOL in healthy postmenopausal women at risk for breast cancer.
