Benefits in radical mastectomy protocol: a randomized trial evaluating the use of regional anesthesia. Surgery is the first-line treatment for early, localized, or operable breast cancer. Regional anesthesia during mastectomy may offer the prevention of <condition>postoperative pain</condition>. One potential protocol is the combination of <intervention>serratus anterior plane block (SAM block)</intervention> with <intervention>pectoral nerve block I (PECS I)</intervention>, but the results and potential benefits are limited. Our study compared general anesthesia with or without SAM block + PECS I during radical mastectomy with axillary node dissection and breast reconstruction using evaluations of pain, opioid consumption, side effects and serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10. This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. <No-of-participants>Fifty patients</No-of-participants> were randomized to <control>general anesthesia only</control> or general anesthesia associated with SAM block + PECS I (<intervention-participants>25</intervention-participant<control-participants>s></control-participants> per group). The association of SAM block + PECS I with general anesthesia reduced <outcome>intraoperative fentanyl consumption, morphine use and visual analog pain scale scores</outcome> in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) and at 24 h after surgery. In addition, the anesthetic protocol decreased <outcome>side effects and sedation</outcome> 24 h after surgery compared to patients who underwent general anesthesia only. <outcome>IL-6 levels</outcome> increased after the surgery compared to baseline levels in both groups, and no differences in IL-10 and IL-1 beta levels were observed. Our protocol improved the outcomes of mastectomy, which highlight the importance of improving mastectomy protocols and focusing on the benefits of regional anesthesia.
