Effect of the <intervention>gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue triptorelin</intervention> on the occurrence of <condition>chemotherapy-induced early menopause</condition> in premenopausal women with breast cancer: a randomized trial. Premenopausal patients with breast cancer are at high risk of premature ovarian failure induced by systemic treatments, but no standard strategies for preventing this adverse effect are yet available. To determine the effect of the temporary ovarian suppression obtained by administering the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue triptorelin during chemotherapy on the incidence of early menopause in <eligibility>young patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy</eligibility>. The PROMISE-GIM6 (Prevention of Menopause Induced by Chemotherapy: A Study in Early Breast Cancer Patients-Gruppo Italiano Mammella 6) study, a parallel, randomized, open-label, phase 3 superiority trial, was conducted at 16 sites in <location>Italy</location> and enrolled <No-of-participants>281</No-of-participants> patients <duration>between October 2003 and January 2008</duration>. The patients were <eligibility>premenopausal women with stage I through III breast cancer who were candidates for adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy</eligibility>. Assuming a 60% rate of early menopause in the group treated with <control>chemotherapy alone</control>, it was estimated that 280 patients had to be enrolled to detect a 20% absolute reduction in early menopause in the group treated with chemotherapy plus triptorelin. The intention-to-treat analysis was performed by including all randomized patients and using imputed values for missing data. Before beginning chemotherapy, patients were randomly allocated to receive chemotherapy alone or combined with triptorelin. Triptorelin was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 3.75 mg at least 1 week before the start of chemotherapy and then every 4 weeks for the duration of chemotherapy. <outcome-Measure>Incidence of early menopause</outcome-Measure> (defined as no resumption of menstrual activity and postmenopausal levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol 1 year after the last cycle of chemotherapy). The clinical and tumor characteristics of the <control-participants>133</control-participants> patients randomized to chemotherapy alone and the <intervention-participants>148</intervention-participants> patients randomized to chemotherapy plus triptorelin were similar. Twelve months after the last cycle of chemotherapy (last follow-up, August 18, 2009), the <outcome>rate of early menopause</outcome> was <control-value>25.9%</control-value> in the chemotherapy-alone group and <intervention-value>8.9%</intervention-value> in the chemotherapy plus triptorelin group, an absolute difference of -17% (95% confidence interval, -26% to -7.9%; P &lt;.001). The odds ratio for <outcome>treatment-related early menopause</outcome> was 0.28 (95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.59; P &lt;.001). The use of triptorelin-induced temporary ovarian suppression during chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer reduced the occurrence of chemotherapy-induced early menopause. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00311636.
