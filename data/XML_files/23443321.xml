Association between <intervention>allergies</intervention>, <intervention>asthma</intervention>, and breast cancer risk among women in <location>Ontario, Canada</location>. To investigate the association between allergies, asthma, and breast cancer risk in a large, population-based case-control study. Breast cancer cases (n = <intervention-participants>3,101</intervention-participants>) were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry and population controls (n = <control-participants>3,471</control-participants>) through random digit dialing. <outcome-Measure>Self-reported histories of allergies, hay fever, and asthma</outcome-Measure> were collected by questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between breast cancer risk and history of allergy/hay fever and asthma, with 16 possible confounders examined. Analyses were stratified by menopausal status. A <outcome>history of allergies or hay fever</outcome> was associated with a small reduction in <outcome>breast cancer risk</outcome> [age-adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.86, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.96] and did not differ by menopausal status. <outcome>Asthma</outcome> was not associated with <outcome>breast cancer risk overall</outcome>; however, among premenopausal women, asthma was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (AOR = 0.72, 95 % CI 0.54-0.97). A <outcome>history of allergies</outcome> may be associated with a modest reduction in <outcome>breast cancer risk</outcome>. Asthma does not appear to be associated with breast cancer risk overall; however, asthma may be associated with reduced breast cancer risk among premenopausal women.
