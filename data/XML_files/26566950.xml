A pilot randomized controlled trial of <intervention>telephone</intervention> intervention to increase Breast Cancer Screening uptake in socially deprived areas in <location>Scotland</location> (TELBRECS). To determine whether a brief telephone support intervention could increase breast cancer screening uptake among lower socio-demographic women in Scotland, via eliciting and addressing barriers to screening attendance. In a pilot randomized controlled trial, <eligibility>participants receiving a reminder letter for a missed screening appointment</eligibility> (<duration>February-June 2014</duration>) were randomized to four arms: <control>No telephone call (control)</control>, Simple telephone reminder (TEL), Telephone support (TEL-SUPP), or Telephone support plus anticipated regret (TEL-SUPP-AR). Primary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>making an appointment</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>attending breast screening</outcome-Measure>. Of <No-of-participants>856</No-of-participants> women randomized and analysed on intention-to-treat basis, compared with controls, more women in the telephone intervention groups <outcome>made an appointment</outcome> (control: <control-value>8.8%</control-value>, TEL: <intervention-value>20.3%</intervention-value>, TEL-SUPP: <intervention-value>14.1%</intervention-value>; TEL-SUPP-AR: <intervention-value>16.8%</intervention-value>, χ(2)(3) = 12.0, p = .007) and <outcome>attended breast screening</outcome> (control: <control-value>6.9%</control-value>, TEL: <intervention-value>16.5%</intervention-value>, TEL-SUPP: <intervention-value>11.3%</intervention-value>; TEL-SUPP-AR: <intervention-value>13.1%</intervention-value>, χ(2)(3) = 9.8, p = .020). Of 559 women randomized to the three telephone groups, 404 were successfully contacted and <No-of-participants>247</No-of-participants> participated in the intervention. Intervention participants (ie. per protocol analysis) were more likely to make (<intervention-value>17%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>10%</control-value>, χ(2)(1) = 7.0, p = .008) and attend (<intervention-value>13%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>7%</control-value>, χ(2)(1) = 5.5, p = .019) an <outcome>appointment</outcome> than non-participants, but there were no differences in attendance between the three telephone groups. A simple telephone reminder doubled attendance at breast screening in women from lower socio-demographic areas who had not attended their initial appointment, compared with a reminder letter only (odds ratio 2.12, 95% CI (1.2, 3.8)). However, contacting women proved problematic and there was no additional effect of telephone support or anticipated regret.
