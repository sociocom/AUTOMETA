Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial of Low-Dose <intervention>Tamoxifen</intervention> to Prevent <condition>Local and Contralateral Recurrence in Breast Intraepithelial Neoplasia</condition>. Tamoxifen administered for <duration>5 years</duration> at 20 mg/d is effective in breast cancer treatment and prevention, but toxicity has limited its broad use. Biomarker trials showed that 5 mg/d is not inferior to 20 mg/d in decreasing breast cancer proliferation. We hypothesized that a lower dose given for a shorter period could be as effective in preventing recurrence from breast intraepithelial neoplasia but have a lower toxicity than the standard dose. We conducted a multicenter randomized trial of tamoxifen, 5 mg/d or <control>placebo</control> administered for 3 years after surgery in <eligibility>women with hormone-sensitive or unknown breast intraepithelial neoplasia, including atypical ductal hyperplasia and lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ</eligibility>. The primary end point was the <outcome-Measure>incidence of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>Five hundred</No-of-participants> women <average-age>75 years of age or younger</average-age> were included. After a median follow-up of 5.1 years (interquartile range, 3.9-6.3 years), there were <intervention-value>14</intervention-value> <outcome>neoplastic events</outcome> with tamoxifen and <control-value>28</control-value> with placebo (11.6 v 23.9 per 1,000 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.92; P = .02), which resulted in a 5-year number needed to treat of 22 (95% CI, 20 to 27). Tamoxifen decreased <outcome>contralateral breast events</outcome> by <intervention-value>75%</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>three</intervention-value> v <control-value>12</control-value> events; hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.88; P = .02). <outcome>Patient-reported outcomes</outcome> were not different between arms except for a slight increase in frequency of daily hot flashes with tamoxifen (P = .02). There were <intervention-value>12</intervention-value> <outcome>serious adverse events</outcome> with tamoxifen and <control-value>16</control-value> with placebo, including <intervention-value>one</intervention-value> <adverse-effect>deep vein thrombosis</adverse-effect> and <intervention-value>one</intervention-value> <adverse-effect>stage I endometrial cancer</adverse-effect> with tamoxifen and <control-value>one</control-value> <adverse-effect>pulmonary embolism</adverse-effect> with placebo. Tamoxifen at 5 mg/d for 3 years can halve the recurrence of breast intraepithelial neoplasia with a limited toxicity, which provides a new treatment option in these disorders.
