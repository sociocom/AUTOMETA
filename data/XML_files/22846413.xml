Randomized trial of <intervention>pentoxifylline</intervention> and <intervention>vitamin E</intervention> vs <control>standard follow-up</control> after breast irradiation to prevent <condition>breast fibrosis</condition>, evaluated by tissue compliance meter. To conduct a randomized clinical trial to determine whether the combination of pentoxifylline (PTX) and vitamin E given for 6 months after breast/chest wall irradiation effectively prevents radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF). <No-of-participants>Fifty-three</No-of-participants> <eligibility>breast cancer patients with localized disease</eligibility> were enrolled and randomized to treatment with oral PTX 400 mg 3 times daily and oral vitamin E 400 IU daily for 6 months after radiation (n=<intervention-participants>26</intervention-participants>), or standard follow up (n=<control-participants>27</control-participants>). <outcome-Measure>Tissue compliance meter (TCM) measurements</outcome-Measure> were obtained at 18 months to compare tissue compliance in the irradiated and untreated breast/chest wall in treated subjects and controls. Measurements were obtained at 2 mirror image sites on each breast/chest wall, and the average difference in tissue compliance was scored. Differences in TCM measurements were compared using a t test. Subjects were followed a minimum of <duration>2 years</duration> for <outcome-Measure>local recurrence</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>disease-free survival</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>overall survival</outcome-Measure>. The <outcome>mean difference in TCM measurements</outcome> in the 2 groups was 0.88 mm, median of 1.00 mm (treated) and 2.10 mm, median of 2.4 mm (untreated). The difference between the 2 groups was significant (P=.0478). <outcome>Overall survival</outcome> (<intervention-value>100%</intervention-value> treated, <control-value>90.6%</control-value> controls at 5 years) and <outcome>disease-free survival</outcome> (<intervention-value>96.2%</intervention-value> treated, <control-value>86.8%</control-value> controls at 5 years) were not significantly different in the 2 groups. This study of postirradiation breast cancer patients treated with PTX/vitamin E or standard follow-up indicated a significant difference in radiation-induced fibrosis as measured by TCM. There was no observed impact on local control or survival within the first 2 years of follow-up. The treatment was safe and well tolerated. Pentoxifylline/vitamin E may be clinically useful in preventing fibrosis after radiation in high-risk patients.
