A randomized trial of dietary intervention for breast cancer prevention. Epidemiologic data and animal experiments suggest that dietary fat may influence risk of breast cancer. To determine whether intervention with a <intervention>low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet</intervention> would reduce breast cancer incidence in women at increased risk of the disease, we carried out a randomized controlled trial in <location>Canada</location>. We recruited <No-of-participants>4,690</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with extensive mammographic density</eligibility> and randomized them to an intervention group or a <control>comparison group</control>. The intervention group received intensive dietary counseling to reduce fat intake to a target of 15% of calories and increase carbohydrate to 65% of calories. Dietary intakes were assessed throughout using food records. Subjects were followed for at least <duration>7 years</duration> and for an average of <duration>10 years</duration>. The main outcome was <outcome-Measure>invasive breast cancer</outcome-Measure>. <outcome>Percentage of calories from fat in the intervention group decreased</outcome> from <intervention-value>30%</intervention-value> <outcome>at baseline</outcome> to <intervention-value>20%</intervention-value> <outcome>after randomization</outcome> and remained <control-value>9%</control-value> to <control-value>10%</control-value> lower than the comparison group throughout. There were <intervention-value>118</intervention-value> <outcome>invasive breast cancers</outcome> in the intervention group and <control-value>102</control-value> in the comparison group [adjusted hazard ratio = 1.19 (95% CI: 0.91-1.55)]. Analysis of food records showed that fat intake at baseline and after randomization was not associated with total breast cancer incidence. <outcome>Greater weight and lower carbohydrate intake</outcome> at baseline and after randomization were associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Our findings suggest that a sustained reduction in dietary fat intake did not reduce risk of breast cancer in women with extensive mammographic density. Weight and carbohydrate intakes were associated with risk of ER-positive breast cancer.
