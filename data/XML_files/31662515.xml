Impact of <intervention>Awake Breast Cancer Surgery</intervention> on <condition>Postoperative Lymphocyte Responses</condition>. Surgical stress and anesthesia affect the patient's immune system. Analysis of the lymphocyte response after breast-conserving surgery was conducted to investigate the differences between effects after general and local anesthesia. <No-of-participants>Fifty-six</No-of-participants> patients with breast cancer were enrolled for BCS through local or general anesthesia. <outcome-Measure>Total leukocytes, total lymphocytes, lymphocyte-subsets including CD3+, CD19+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+CD56+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratio was examined at baseline and on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3</outcome-Measure>. Baseline data showed no statistical difference between the two groups. Within-group ANOVA test showed significant differences for <outcome>total leukocyte count</outcome> (p&lt;.001), <outcome>total lymphocyte count</outcome> (p=0.009) and <outcome>proportion of natural-killer cells</outcome> (p=0.01) in the control group. Between-group analysis showed lower <outcome>median values of total lymphocytes</outcome> in the awake surgery group <outcome>on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3</outcome> (p=0.001, p=0.02 and p=0.01, respectively) when compared to the control group. Patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia had higher <outcome>total lymphocyte counts on postoperative day</outcome> 2 (p=0.04). In this randomized study, breast-conserving surgery plus local anesthesia had a lower impact on postoperative lymphocyte response when compared to the same procedure performed under general anesthesia.
