Pilot randomised controlled trial of a <intervention>radiation therapist-led educational</intervention> intervention for breast cancer patients prior to commencing radiotherapy. Although patients receive information prior to commencing radiotherapy, they often experience anxiety and distress. We conducted a pilot randomised controlled trial to determine whether a radiation therapist led psycho-educational intervention for <eligibility>breast cancer patients prior to radiotherapy</eligibility> is likely to be effective in reducing <condition>radiotherapy-related concerns</condition>, <condition>patient anxiety</condition> and <condition>depression</condition>. The intervention comprised two face-to-face consultations with a radiation therapist (one prior to radiation planning and the other prior to treatment). Patients completed surveys at baseline, prior to treatment planning and on the first day of treatment. Outcome measures included the <outcome-Measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>Radiation Therapy Related Patient Concerns</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>Radiation Therapy Knowledge Scales</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>One hundred and twenty two</No-of-participants> patients completed baseline measures. <control-participants>Fifty-eight</control-participants> patients received <control>usual care</control>, and <intervention-participants>64</intervention-participants> received the intervention. After the first consultation, <outcome>patient anxiety</outcome> was significantly lower in the intervention group (p = 0.048), as were <outcome>concerns about radiotherapy</outcome> (p = 0.001). There were no differences between groups for <outcome>depression</outcome>. <outcome>Patient knowledge</outcome> for the intervention group was higher after the first consultation (p &lt; 0.001). This intervention is likely to be effective in reducing patient anxiety and concerns and increasing knowledge. Future research is required to test this intervention with a larger population.
