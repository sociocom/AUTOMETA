Axillary lymphadenectomy for breast cancer. A randomized controlled trial comparing a <intervention>bipolar vessel sealing system</intervention> to the <control>conventional technique</control>. To compare safety and efficacy of a bipolar vessel sealing system (BVSS) to the conventional technique in axillary node dissection. <No-of-participants>116</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with breast cancer</eligibility> were randomized to conventional node dissection surgical technique (control; n = <control-participants>58</control-participants>) by scalpel and monopolar cautery or using an electrothermal BVSS (study group; n = <intervention-participants>58</intervention-participants>). The median (range) <outcome>total volume of fluid collected by drain and aspirations</outcome> was 305 (30-1420) mL in the study group and 335 (80-1070) mL in the control group (p = 0.325). The median (range) <outcome>total volume of lymph collected by percutaneous aspirations</outcome> was 207.5 (40-1050) mL in the study group and 505 (270-705) mL in the control group (p = 0.010). The <outcome>incidence of seroma</outcome> was similar in both groups (p = 0.845). The <outcome>axillary drain was removed</outcome> earlier in the study group than in controls (p = 0.046). The use of a BVSS offers marginal advantages when compared to the conventional technique.
