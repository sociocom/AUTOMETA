A randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial of the routine use of <intervention>preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis</intervention> in modified radical mastectomy. The effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of <condition>surgical site infection (SSI)</condition> following specific types of breast cancer surgery remains uncertain. This study assessed the effectiveness of prophylaxis in modified radical mastectomy (MRM). <eligibility>Women undergoing MRM for breast cancer</eligibility> were recruited. Women were excluded who had diabetes mellitus, severe malnutrition or known allergy to cephalosporins; were receiving corticosteroid therapy or were treated with antibiotics within one week prior to surgery; were scheduled for simultaneous breast reconstruction or bilateral oophorectomy; had existing local infection. Participants were randomized to receive either <intervention>intravenous cefazolin</intervention> 1 g or <control>placebo</control> within 30 min prior to skin incision. Standard skin preparation and operative technique for MRM were carried out. Wounds were assessed for <outcome-Measure>SSI and other complications weekly</outcome-Measure> for <duration>30 days</duration>. A total of <No-of-participants>254</No-of-participants> women were recruited. Age, clinical stage, prior chemotherapy, and operative time were similar for antibiotic and placebo groups. The <outcome>overall incidence of SSI</outcome> was 14.2 %. There were no significant differences in the <outcome>infection rate</outcome> over the 30-day follow-up period between the placebo and antibiotic groups (<control-value>15 %</control-value> vs <intervention-value>13.4 %</intervention-value>; p = 0.719) or at each week. The majority of SSI were either cellulitis or superficial infection for both groups. There were no significant differences between groups in treatments required for S<outcome>SI, incidence of hematoma or seroma</outcome>. The findings of this study, alone and when meta-analyzed with data from studies in similar surgical populations, do not support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in MRM.
