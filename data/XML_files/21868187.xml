Dramatic dietary fat reduction is feasible for breast cancer patients: Results of the randomised study, WINS (<location>UK</location>) - stage 1. The influence of dietary fat on breast tumour growth(1) and, more recently, on treatment outcomes,(2,3) suggests an important role for dietary advice in the future health of breast cancer patients. The Women's Intervention Nutrition Study (UK) - Stage 1 assessed the feasibility of achieving and maintaining a ≥ 50% reduction in reported fat intake in <eligibility>postmenopausal, early stage breast cancer patients in the UK</eligibility>. This study recruited patients in <location>South-east England</location> between 2000 and 2005. They were randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1 (n = <intervention-participants>54</intervention-participants>), received specific <intervention>dietary counselling</intervention> to halve their reported fat intake and maintain this low fat intake. Group 2 (n = <control>53</control>) received <control>healthy eating advice only</control>. Dietitian-led group sessions provided support for women in both groups over <duration>2 years</duration>. (4) Validated <outcome-Measure>four-day diaries</outcome-Measure> were used to measure intake. Data analysis used Generalised Linear Model (GLM) for repeated measures and logistic regression. A significantly greater proportion of women in Group 1 reported a <outcome>fat intake reduction</outcome> of ≥ 50% at 3 months (p &lt; .001) and 24 months (p &lt; .001) than in Group 2. The <outcome>size of the effect of active dietary counselling</outcome> was <intervention-value>37%</intervention-value> <outcome>at 3 months</outcome> (95%CI: 21-54%) and <intervention-value>35%</intervention-value> <outcome>at 24 months</outcome> (95%CI: 17-53%). <outcome>Mean fat intake</outcome> was halved at 3 months and 24 months in Group 1 only. Demonstrating such feasibility is a key step towards defining diet's role in the secondary prevention of breast cancer.
