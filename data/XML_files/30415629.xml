<intervention>Vitamin D</intervention> Supplements and Prevention of Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease. It is unclear whether supplementation with vitamin D reduces the risk of cancer or cardiovascular disease, and data from randomized trials are limited. We conducted a nationwide, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, with a two-by-two factorial design, of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) at a dose of 2000 IU per day and marine n-3 (also called omega-3) fatty acids at a dose of 1 g per day for the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among men <average-age>50 years of age or older</average-age> and women <average-age>55 years of age or older</average-age> in the <location>United States</location>. Primary end points were <outcome>invasive cancer of any type</outcome> and <outcome>major cardiovascular events</outcome> (a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). Secondary end points included <outcome-Measure>site-specific cancers</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>death from cancer</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>additional cardiovascular events</outcome-Measure>. This article reports the results of the comparison of vitamin D with <control>placebo</control>. A total of <No-of-participants>25,871</No-of-participants> participants, including 5106 <ethinicity>black</ethinicity> participants, underwent randomization. Supplementation with vitamin D was not associated with a lower risk of either of the primary end points. During a median follow-up of 5.3 years, <outcome>cancer was diagnosed</outcome> in 1617 participants (<intervention-value>793</intervention-value> in the vitamin D group and <control-value>824</control-value> in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88 to 1.06; P=0.47). A <outcome>major cardiovascular event</outcome> occurred in 805 participants (<intervention-value>396</intervention-value> in the vitamin D group and <control-value>409</control-value> in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.12; P=0.69). In the analyses of secondary end points, the hazard ratios were as follows: for <outcome>death from cancer</outcome> (341 deaths), 0.83 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.02); for breast cancer, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.31); for prostate cancer, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.07); for colorectal cancer, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.73 to 1.62); for the expanded composite end point of major cardiovascular events plus coronary revascularization, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.08); for myocardial infarction, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.19); for stroke, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.20); and for death from cardiovascular causes, 1.11 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.40). In the analysis of <outcome>death from any cause</outcome> (978 deaths), the hazard ratio was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.12). No excess risks of hypercalcemia or other adverse events were identified. Supplementation with vitamin D did not result in a lower incidence of invasive cancer or cardiovascular events than placebo.
