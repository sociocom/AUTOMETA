Randomized Multicenter Placebo-Controlled Trial of <intervention>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</intervention> for the Control of <condition>Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Musculoskeletal Pain</condition>: SWOG S0927. Musculoskeletal symptoms are the most common adverse effects of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and can result in decreased quality of life and discontinuation of therapy. Omega-3 fatty acids (O3-FAs) can be effective in decreasing arthralgia resulting from rheumatologic conditions and reducing serum triglycerides. <eligibility>Women with early-stage breast cancer receiving an AI who had a worst joint pain/stiffness score ≥ 5 of 10</eligibility> using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) were randomly assigned to receive either O3-FAs 3.3 g or placebo (soybean/corn oil) daily for 24 weeks. Clinically significant change was defined as ≥ 2-point drop from baseline. Patients also completed <outcome-Measure>quality-of-life</outcome-Measure> (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms) and additional pain/stiffness assessments at baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 24. Serial fasting blood was collected for lipid analysis. Among <No-of-participants>262</No-of-participants> patients registered, <No-of-participants>249</No-of-participants> were evaluable, with <intervention-participants>122</intervention-participants> women in the O3-FA arm and <control-participants>127</control-participants> in the <control>placebo</control> arm. Compared with baseline, the <outcome>mean observed BPI-SF score</outcome> decreased by 1.74 points at 12 weeks and 2.22 points at 24 weeks with O3-FAs and by 1.49 and 1.81 points, respectively, with placebo. In a linear regression adjusting for the <outcome>baseline score, osteoarthritis, and taxane use</outcome>, adjusted 12-week BPI-SF scores did not differ by arm (P = .58). <outcome>Triglyceride levels</outcome> decreased in patients receiving O3-FA treatment and remained the same for those receiving placebo (P = .01). No between-group differences were seen for <outcome>HDL, LDL, or C-reactive protein</outcome>. We found a substantial (> 50%) and sustained improvement in AI arthralgia for both O3-FAs and placebo but found no meaningful difference between the groups.
