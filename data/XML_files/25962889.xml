An exercise trial targeting <ethinicity>African-American</ethinicity> women with metabolic syndrome and at high risk for breast cancer: Rationale, design, and methods. Metabolic syndrome and obesity are known risk factors for breast cancers. Exercise interventions can potentially modify circulating biomarkers of breast cancer risk but evidence in African-Americans and women with metabolic syndrome is lacking. The Focused Intervention on Exercise to Reduce CancEr (FIERCE) trial is a prospective, 6-month, 3-arm, randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of <intervention>exercise</intervention> on obesity, metabolic syndrome components, and breast cancer biomarkers among <eligibility>African-American women at high risk of breast cancer</eligibility>. <No-of-participants>Two hundred-forty</No-of-participants> <eligibility>inactive women with metabolic syndrome and absolute risk of breast cancer â‰¥ 1.40</eligibility> will be randomized to one of the three trial arms: 1) a supervised, facility-based exercise arm; 2) a home-based exercise arm; and 3) a <control>control group</control> that maintains physical activity levels through the course of the trial. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome variables are <outcome-Measure>anthropometric indicators of obesity</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>metabolic syndrome components</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>inflammatory</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>insulin-pathway</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>hormonal biomarkers of breast cancer risk</outcome-Measure>. The FIERCE trial will provide evidence on whether a short-term exercise intervention might be effective in reducing breast cancer risk among African-American women with comorbidities and high breast cancer risk--a group traditionally under-represented in non-therapeutic breast cancer trials.
