<intervention>Fenretinide</intervention> breast cancer prevention trial: drug and retinol plasma levels in relation to age and disease outcome. To assess, in women participating in a breast cancer prevention trialon fenretinide (4-HPR), the relationship of drug and retinol levels with the risk of second breast malignancy, taking into account age and menopausal status. In a multicenter prevention trial, <eligibility>women with early breast cancer</eligibility> were randomly assigned to receive <control>no treatment</control> or 200 mg of 4-HPR/day for <duration>5 years</duration>. Blood was collected at baseline and on a yearly basis during intervention from women recruited at the Istituto Tumori (<location>Milan, Italy</location>; <intervention-participants>818</intervention-participants> and <control-participants>756</control-participants> in the 4-HPR and control arm, respectively, who accounted for 53% of the participants in the trial). The <outcome-Measure>plasma concentrations of 4-HPR</outcome-Measure>, its main <outcome-Measure>metabolite N-(4-methoxyphenyl) retinamide</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>retinol</outcome-Measure> were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Three age ranges (&lt;or=45, 46-55, and >or=56 years), menopausal status at baseline, and disease outcome at a median follow-up of 97 months were taken into account in the analysis. Baseline retinol levels were significantly lower (P &lt;r= 0.05) in subjects &lt;or= 45 years than in older subjects, and among subjects in the age range 46-55 years, they were significantly higher (P &lt;r= 0.001) in those in postmenopause than in those in premenopause. Baseline retinol levels were not related to the risk of a second breast malignancy. <outcome>4-HPR and N-(4-methoxyphenyl)retinamide levels were not affected by menopausal status</outcome>. They slightly, but significantly (P &lt;r= 0.05), increased with age (>or=46 years versus &lt;or=45 years) but only in disease-free subjects. Among subjects &lt; 45 years, they were slightly, but significantly (P &lt;r= 0.05), higher in those subjects in which breast cancer recurred. <outcome>4-HPR treatment caused a retinol level reduction</outcome>, which was strongly (r >or= 0.71; P &lt;r= 0.001) related to pretreatment retinol levels. <outcome>Retinol plasma levels</outcome> increased with age and after menopause and were not related to breast cancer recurrence. <outcome>4-HPR levels</outcome> were lower in subjects &lt; 45 years than in older subjects. The inverse relationship between drug plasma levels and 4-HPR preventive effects observed in young women suggests a role for 4-HPR plasma sequestration in 4-HPR biological activity.
