Differential effects of <intervention>metformin</intervention> on breast cancer proliferation according to markers of insulin resistance and tumor subtype in a randomized presurgical trial. Treatment of diabetics with metformin is associated with decreased breast cancer risk in observational studies, but it remains unclear if this drug has clinical antineoplastic activity. In a recent presurgical trial, we found a heterogeneous effect of metformin on breast cancer proliferation (ki-67) depending upon insulin resistance (HOMA index). Here, we determined the associations of additional serum biomarkers of insulin resistance, tumor subtype, and drug concentration with ki-67 response to metformin. <No-of-participants>Two-hundred</No-of-participants> <eligibility>non-diabetic women</eligibility> were randomly allocated to metformin (850 mg/bid) or <control>placebo</control> for <duration>4 weeks</duration> prior to breast cancer surgery. The <outcome-Measure>ki-67 response to metformin</outcome-Measure> was assessed comparing data obtained from baseline biopsy (ki-67 and tumor subtype) and serum markers (HOMA index, C-peptide, IGF-I, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, free IGF-I, hs-CRP, adiponectin) with the same measurements at definitive surgery. For patients with a blood sample taken within 24 h from last drug intake, metformin level was measured. Compared with placebo, metformin significantly decreased <outcome>ki-67</outcome> in women with HOMA > 2.8, those in the lowest IGFBP-1 quintile, those in the highest IGFBP-3 quartile, those with low free IGF-I, those in the top hs-CRP tertile, and those with HER2-positive tumors. In women with HOMA index > 2.8, <outcome>drug levels</outcome> were positively correlated with the ki-67 decrease, whereas no trend was noted in women with HOMA &lt; 2.8 (p-interaction = 0.07). At conventional antidiabetic doses, the effect of metformin on tumor ki-67 of non-diabetic breast cancer patients varies with host and tumor characteristics. These findings are relevant to design breast cancer prevention and treatment trials with metformin.
