A randomized trial of a <intervention>telephone-delivered exercise</intervention> intervention for non-urban dwelling women newly diagnosed with breast cancer: exercise for health. Physical activity is important following breast cancer. Trials of non-face-to-face interventions are needed to assist in reaching women living outside major metropolitan areas. This study seeks to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a telephone-delivered, mixed aerobic and resistance exercise intervention for non-urban <ethinicity>Australian</ethinicity> <eligibility>women with breast cancer</eligibility>. A randomized controlled trial comparing an <duration>8-month</duration> intervention delivered by exercise physiologists (n = <intervention-participants>73</intervention-participants>) to <control>usual care</control> (n = <control-participants>70</control-participants>). Sixty-one percent recruitment rate and 96% retention at 12 months; <intervention-value>79%</intervention-value> of women in the intervention group <outcome>received at least 75% of calls</outcome>; odds (OR, 95% CI) of meeting intervention targets favored the intervention group for resistance training (OR 3.2; 1.2, 8.9) and aerobic (OR 2.1; 0.8, 5.5) activity. Given the limited availability of physical activity programs for non-urban women with breast cancer, results provide strong support for feasibility and modest support for the efficacy of telephone-delivered interventions.
