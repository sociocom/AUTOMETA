An association of <intervention>boswellia</intervention>, <intervention>betaine</intervention> and <intervention>myo-inositol</intervention> (Eumastós) in the treatment of mammographic breast density: a randomized, double-blind study. Mammographic breast density is a recognized risk factor for breast cancer. The causes that lead to the proliferation of the glandular breast tissue and, therefore, to an increase of breast density are still unclear. However, a treatment strategy to reduce the mammary density may bring about very relevant clinical outcomes in breast cancer prevention. Myo-inositol is a six-fold alcohol of cyclohexane, has already been proved to modulate different pathways: inflammatory, metabolic, oxidative and endocrine processes, in a wide array of human diseases, including cancer and the genesis of mammary gland and breast diseases, like fibrosis, as well as metabolic and endocrine cues. Similarly, boswellic acid and betaine (three-methyl glycine) both inhibit inflammation and exert protective effects on breast physiology. Based on this scientific background, we hypothesized that a combination including, boswellic acid, betaine and myo-inositol would be able to reduce breast density working on different pathways. In this study, <No-of-participants>seventy-six</No-of-participants> <eligibility>premenopausal women</eligibility> were randomly assigned to the <control>placebo</control> and the experimental drug arms (Eumastós) for <duration>six months</duration>. After 6 months of treatment, statistically significant difference between the two groups was recorded on the <outcome>breast density reduction</outcome> (<intervention-value>60%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>9%</control-value>), using mammographic as well as ultrasound examination. Preliminary data collected here with support the starting assumptions, that the association comprising boswellic acid, betaine and myo-inositol significantly reduces mammary density, providing the first evidence for a new and safe approach for the management of mammographic density treatment.
