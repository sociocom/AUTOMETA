<intervention>Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management</intervention> for <eligibility>Healthy Women at Risk for Breast Cancer</eligibility>: a Novel Application of a Proven Intervention. Women at risk for breast cancer report elevated psychological distress, which has been adversely associated with cancer-relevant behaviors and biology. The present study sought to examine the effects of a <duration>10-week</duration> cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) group intervention on distress among women with a family history of breast cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to CBSM (N = <intervention-participants>82</intervention-participants>) or a <control>wait-list comparison group</control> (N = <control-participants>76</control-participants>). <outcome-Measure>Baseline to postintervention effects of CBSM on depressive symptoms and perceived stress</outcome-Measure> were examined using hierarchical regression. CBSM participants reported significantly <outcome>lower posttreatment depressive symptoms</outcome> (β = -0.17, p &lt; 0.05) and <outcome>perceived stress</outcome> (β = -0.23, p &lt; 0.05) than wait-list comparison participants. Additionally, greater relaxation practice predicted <outcome>lower distress</outcome>. Group-based CBSM intervention is feasible and can reduce psychological distress among women with a family history of breast cancer. The present findings represent an encouraging avenue for the future application of CBSM. ( Clinicaltrials.gov number NCT00121160).
