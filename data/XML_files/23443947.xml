Technical effects of adding 1 % <intervention>lidocaine</intervention> to technetium sulfur colloid for sentinel lymphatic mapping in early breast cancer: analysis of data from a double-blind randomized controlled trial. A practice standard in sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in breast cancer is intradermal injection of technetium-99m sulfur colloid (Tc-99m), resulting in significant patient discomfort and pain. A previous randomized controlled trial showed that adding lidocaine to Tc-99m significantly reduced radioisotope injection-related pain. We tested whether 1 % lidocaine admixed with Tc-99m affects feasibility of SLN mapping. <duration>Between January 2006 and April 2009</duration>, <No-of-participants>140</No-of-participants> <eligibility>patients with early breast cancer</eligibility> were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive standard topical 4 % <control>lidocaine cream and intradermal Tc-99m (control)</control> or to one of three other study groups: topical placebo cream and injection of Tc-99m containing <intervention>sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)</intervention>, 1 % lidocaine, or both. All SLN data were collected prospectively. Study groups were comparable for clinicopathological parameters. As previously reported, the addition of 1 % lidocaine to the radioisotope solution significantly improved <outcome>patient comfort</outcome>. Overall <outcome>SLN identification rate</outcome> in the trial was 93 %. <outcome>Technical aspects of SLN biopsy</outcome> were similar for all groups, including time from injection to operation, first SLN (SLN 1) gamma probe counts, ex vivo counts for SLN 1 and SLN 2, and axillary bed counts. <outcome>SLN identification rates</outcome> were comparable statistically: control (<control-value>96 %</control-value>), lidocaine (<intervention-value>90 %</intervention-value>), sodium bicarbonate (<intervention-value>97 %</intervention-value>), and sodium bicarbonate-lidocaine (<intervention-value>90 %</intervention-value>). The control group had a significantly higher <outcome>SLN 2/SLN 1 ex vivo count ratio</outcome>, and the <outcome>number of SLNs detected</outcome> was significantly reduced in the lidocaine versus no-lidocaine groups (p &lt; 0.05). Addition of 1 % lidocaine to standard radioisotope solution for SLN mapping in breast cancer is associated with fewer SLNs detected, but it does not appear to compromise SLN identification.
