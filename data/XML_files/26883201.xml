<intervention>Decision aid</intervention> on breast cancer screening reduces attendance rate: results of a large-scale, randomized, controlled study by the DECIDEO group. Controversies regarding the benefits of breast cancer screening programs have led to the promotion of new strategies taking into account individual preferences, such as decision aid. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a decision aid leaflet on the participation of women invited to participate in a national breast cancer screening program. This Randomized, multicentre, controlled trial. Women aged <average-age>50 to 74 years</average-age>, were randomly assigned to receive either a decision aid or the <control>usual invitation letter</control>. Primary outcome was the <outcome-Measure>participation rate 12 months after the invitation</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>16 000</No-of-participants> women were randomized and <No-of-participants>15 844</No-of-participants> included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The <outcome-Measure>participation rate</outcome-Measure> in the intervention group was <intervention-value>40.25%</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>3174</intervention-value>/<intervention-participants>7885</intervention-participants> women) compared with <control-value>42.13%</control-value> (<control-value>3353</control-value>/<control-participants>7959</control-participants>) in the control group (p = 0.02). Previous attendance for screening (RR = 6.24; [95%IC: 5.75-6.77]; p &lt; 0.0001) and medium household income (RR = 1.05; [95%IC: 1.01-1.09]; p = 0.0074) were independently associated with attendance for screening. This large-scale study demonstrates that the decision aid reduced the participation rate. The decision aid activate the decision making process of women toward non-attendance to screening. These results show the importance of promoting informed patient choices, especially when those choices cannot be anticipated.
