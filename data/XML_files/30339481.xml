Do <intervention>Compression Sleeves</intervention> Reduce the Incidence of <condition>Arm Lymphedema</condition> and Improve Quality of Life? Two-Year Results from a Prospective Randomized Trial in Breast Cancer Survivors. In a previous randomized controlled trial it has been demonstrated that arm compression sleeves worn immediately after breast cancer surgery, including axillary lymph node removal in addition to physical therapy are able to reduce the occurrence of early postoperative swelling and of arm lymphedema up to 1 year and to improve quality of life. The aim of the present investigation was to check the further development of the arm swelling in patients using compression sleeves or not, and to compare the quality of life in <eligibility>women treated due to breast cancer 2 years after surgery</eligibility>. <intervention-participants>Twenty</intervention-participants> from originally 23 patients who still wore their compression sleeves (15 mmHg) and <control-participants>21</control-participants> from 22 patients who had been randomized into the <control>control group without compression</control> could be seen after one more year. <outcome-Measure>Arm volume measurements</outcome-Measure> were performed and <outcome-Measure>quality of life</outcome-Measure> (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires) was assessed. <intervention-value>Three</intervention-value> from <intervention-participants>20</intervention-participants> patients in the compression group (CG) and <control-value>6</control-value> from <control-participants>21</control-participants> without compression showed <outcome>arm lymphedema</outcome>, defined by an increase of the arm volume exceeding 10% compared with the preoperative values. Significant <outcome>improvement of several quality of life parameters</outcome> were found in the CG. Light compression sleeves worn for 2 years are not only able to reduce the incidence of early postoperative edema and of lymphedema, but also lead to a significant improvement of important quality-of-life parameters like physical functioning, fatigue, pain, arm and breast symptoms, and future perspectives.
