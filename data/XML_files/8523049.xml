Adequate locoregional treatment for early breast cancer may prevent secondary dissemination. To analyze different events that determine event-free survival (EFS) in a randomized trial on <intervention>adjuvant radiotherapy</intervention> in <eligibility>early breast cancer patients with more than 15 years of follow-up evaluation</eligibility>. The trial included <No-of-participants>960</No-of-participants> patients with a unilateral, operable breast cancer. Surgery consisted of a modified radical mastectomy. The trial compared three arms, as follows: preoperative radiotherapy, postoperative radiotherapy, and <control>no adjuvant treatment</control>. Events were analyzed by a competing-risk approach. A proportional hazards multiple regression model was used to analyze the <outcome-Measure>effects of radiotherapy on the risk of distant metastasis</outcome-Measure>. Similar analyses were performed separately for node-negative [N(-)] and node-positive [N(+)] patients in the two groups that did not include preoperative radiotherapy. Radiotherapy produced a fivefold decrease of the <outcome>risk of local recurrence</outcome> (P &lt;.0001). In N(+) patients, postoperative radiotherapy decreased the <outcome>risk of distant dissemination</outcome> (relative risk, 0.63). When local recurrence was introduced in the model as a time-dependent covariate, this factor was predictive of distant dissemination (P &lt;.0001) and nullified the effect of postoperative radiotherapy. This finding suggests that the decrease of distant metastases was related to the prevention of local recurrence. A similar effect was found in models that used overall survival as an end point. This study shows that postmastectomy radiotherapy in N(+) breast cancer patients may decrease the distant metastasis rate by preventing local recurrences and thus avoiding secondary dissemination.
