A double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate endometrial safety and gynaecological symptoms in women treated for up to 5 years with tamoxifen or placebo - a substudy for IBIS I Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. This prospective study was performed to investigate the effects of 5-year's use of <intervention>tamoxifen</intervention> in preventive setting on <condition>endometrium and gynaecological symptoms</condition>. Altogether <No-of-participants>96</No-of-participants> women were treated either with tamoxifen (TAM, n=<intervention-participants>45</intervention-participants>) or <control>placebo</control> (PLA, n=<control-participants>51</control-participants>) for up to <duration>5 years</duration> in a randomised, double-blind IBIS I breast cancer prevention trial, clinically followed-up for an additional year and for the occurrence of malignancies at least 9 years <duration>between 2/1995 and 7/2009</duration> in <location>Finland</location>. The gynaecological follow-up with trans-vaginal ultrasound and endometrial biopsies were performed at baseline, at 2.5 and 5 years and at the 6 years follow-up visit. Women in the TAM group <outcome>discontinued the treatment</outcome> significantly more often (<intervention-value>44%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>22%</control-value>; p=0.017) and earlier (at 15 versus 30 months; p=0.044), than those in the PLA group. In postmenopausal women the median <outcome>endometrial thickness</outcome> was significantly increased at five years in the TAM group (median 4.3 versus 2.0mm, p=0.011), but there was no difference between the groups at one year after the treatment. There were also statistically significantly more <outcome>referrals to hospitals due to gynaecological findings</outcome> in the TAM group (risk rates (RR) 3.15; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.12-10.10), but no differences in hysterectomy rates or other serious adverse event rates were observed. The <outcome>discontinuation rate</outcome> in the TAM group was high, and the discontinuations also occurred early. Even though there were significantly more non-serious gynaecological events during the TAM treatment, routine gynaecological follow-up cannot be recommended.
