Effect of <intervention>Dietary Flaxseed Intake</intervention> on Circulating Sex Hormone Levels among <eligibility>Postmenopausal Women</eligibility>: A Randomized Controlled Intervention Trial. Lignan intake, and its richest food source, flaxseed, have been associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Endogenous sex hormones, such as estrogens, play a role in breast cancer development, and lignans may alter these sex hormone levels. To assess the effect of flaxseed on circulating sex hormones, a randomized controlled trial was conducted among <No-of-participants>99</No-of-participants> <eligibility>postmenopausal women</eligibility> in <location>Toronto, Canada</location>. The intervention arm consumed 2 tablespoons (15 g) of ground flaxseed daily for <duration>7 weeks</duration>; the <control>control arm</control> maintained <control>usual diet</control>. <outcome-Measure>Baseline and week 7 concentrations of 14 serum sex hormones</outcome-Measure> were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and immunoassay, and <outcome-Measure>serum enterolignans (lignan biomarker)</outcome-Measure> using LC-MS/MS. Intervention effects on sex hormone levels were assessed using analysis of covariance. <outcome>Serum enterolignans increased</outcome> among the flaxseed arm (+516%). Women consuming flaxseed (vs. controls) had increased <outcome>serum 2-hydroxyestrone</outcome> [treatment effect ratio (TER) = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.18-2.00] and <outcome>2:16α-hydroxyestrone ratio</outcome> (TER =1.54; 95% CI: 1.15-2.06); effects on other hormones were not statistically significant. Within the flaxseed arm, <outcome>change in enterolignan level</outcome> was positively correlated with changes in 2-hydroxyestrone and 2:16α-hydroxyestrone ratio, and negatively with prolactin. Findings suggest flaxseed affects certain circulating sex hormone levels with possible implications for future breast cancer prevention research.
