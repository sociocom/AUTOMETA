<intervention>Low-Fat Dietary</intervention> Pattern and Breast Cancer Mortality in the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Trial. Purpose Earlier Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification trial findings suggested that a low-fat eating pattern may reduce breast cancers with greater mortality. Therefore, as a primary outcome-related analysis from a randomized prevention trial, we examined the long-term influence of this intervention on deaths as a result of and after breast cancer during <duration>8.5 years</duration> (median) of dietary intervention and cumulatively for all breast cancers diagnosed during 16.1 years (median) of follow-up. Patients and Methods The trial randomly assigned <No-of-participants>48,835</No-of-participants> <eligibility>postmenopausal women with normal mammograms and without prior breast cancer</eligibility> <duration>from 1993 to 1998</duration> at 40 <location>US</location> clinical centers to a dietary intervention with goals of a reduction of fat intake to 20% of energy and an increased intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains (40%; n = <intervention-participants>19,541</intervention-participants>) or to a <control>usual diet</control> comparison (60%; n = <control-participants>29,294</control-participants>). Results In the dietary group, fat intake and body weight decreased (all P &lt;.001). During the 8.5-year dietary intervention, with 1,764 incident breast cancers, fewer <outcome>deaths occurred as a result of breast cancer</outcome> in the dietary group, which was not statistically significant (<intervention-value>27</intervention-value> deaths [<intervention-value>0.016%</intervention-value> per year] v <control-value>61</control-value> deaths [<control-value>0.024%</control-value> per year]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.06; P = .08). During the same period, <outcome>deaths after breast cancer</outcome> (n = 134) were significantly reduced (<intervention-value>40</intervention-value> deaths [<intervention-value>0.025%</intervention-value> per year] v <control-value>94</control-value> deaths [<control-value>0.038%</control-value> per year]; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.94; P = .02) by the dietary intervention. <outcome>During the 16.1-year follow-up</outcome>, with 3,030 incident breast cancers, <outcome>deaths after breast cancer</outcome> also were significantly reduced (<intervention-value>234</intervention-value> deaths [<intervention-value>0.085%</intervention-value> per year] v <control-value>443</control-value> deaths [<control-value>0.11%</control-value> per year]; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96; P = .01) in the dietary group. Conclusion Compared with a usual diet comparison group, a low-fat dietary pattern led to a lower incidence of deaths after breast cancer.
