Improving decision making about clinical trial participation - a randomised controlled trial of a decision aid for women considering participation in the IBIS-II breast cancer prevention trial. Decision aids may improve informed consent in clinical trial recruitment, but have not been evaluated in this context. This study investigated whether <intervention>decision aids</intervention> (DAs) can reduce <condition>decisional difficulties</condition> among women considering participation in the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study-II (IBIS-II) trial. The IBIS-II trial investigated breast cancer prevention with anastrazole in two cohorts: <eligibility>women with increased risk (Prevention), and women treated for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</eligibility>. <ethinicity>Australia</ethinicity>, <ethinicity>New Zealand</ethinicity> and <ethinicity>United Kingdom</ethinicity> participants were randomised to receive a DA (DA group) or <control>standard trial consent materials (control group)</control>. Questionnaires were completed after deciding about participation in IBIS-II (post decision) and 3 months later (follow-up). Data from <No-of-participants>112</No-of-participants> Prevention and <No-of-participants>34</No-of-participants> DCIS participants were analysed post decision (<intervention-participants>73</intervention-participants> DA; <control-participants>73</control-participants> control); <No-of-participants>95</No-of-participants> Prevention and <No-of-participants>24</No-of-participants> DCIS participants were analysed at follow-up (<intervention-participants>58</intervention-participants> DA; <control-participants>61</control-participants> control). There was no effect on the primary outcome of <outcome>decisional conflict</outcome>. The DCIS-DA group had higher <outcome>knowledge post decision</outcome>, and the Prevention-DA group had lower <outcome>decisional regret</outcome> at follow-up. This was the first study to evaluate a DA in the clinical trial setting. The results suggest DAs can potentially increase knowledge and reduce decisional regret about clinical trial participation.
