Prevention of <condition>chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy</condition> with <intervention>classical massage</intervention> in <eligibility>breast cancer patients receiving paclitaxel</eligibility>: An assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial. This assessor-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial aimed at investigating the effect of classical massage on chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy and the quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant paclitaxel. A total of <No-of-participants>40</No-of-participants> female breast cancer patients were randomly allocated to the classical massage group (CMG) or the <control>control group</control> (CG). Classical massage was applied to the patients in the CMG before each paclitaxel infusion. The CG received only <control>usual care</control>. <outcome-Measure>Presence of peripheral neuropathic pain and QOL</outcome-Measure> were assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. <outcome-Measure>Nerve conduction studies (NCS) findings</outcome-Measure> were also recorded at baseline and week 12. The <outcome>peripheral neuropathic pain</outcome> was lower in the CMG compared to the CG at week 12 (p &lt; 0.05). The <outcome>sensory and motor sub-scale scores of the QOL</outcome> measure showed statistically significant differences over time in favor of the CMG (p &lt; 0.05). <outcome>Sensory action potential amplitude of the median nerve</outcome> was significantly higher and the tibial nerve latency was significantly shorter in the CMG compared to the CG at week 12. This study suggested that classical massage successfully prevented chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain, improved the QOL, and showed beneficial effects on the NCS findings.
