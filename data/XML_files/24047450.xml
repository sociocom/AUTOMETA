Optimizing expectations to prevent side effects and enhance quality of life in breast cancer patients undergoing endocrine therapy: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial. Adjuvant endocrine therapy can improve disease-free survival and time before recurrence in breast cancer patients. However, it is associated with considerable side effects that negatively affect patients' quality of life and cause non-adherence. The recently demonstrated effect of individual expectations on side-effect development (nocebo effect) suggests that psychological factors play a role in the prevention of side effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate <intervention>cognitive-behavioral side-effect prevention training (SEPT)</intervention> for breast cancer patients. This article describes the study protocol and applied research methods. In a randomized controlled trial, <No-of-participants>184</No-of-participants> female breast cancer patients are assigned to receive either SEPT, <control>standard medical care</control> or a <control>manualized supportive therapy</control> at the start of adjuvant endocrine treatment. SEPT consists of three sessions of cognitive-behavioral training including psychoeducation to provide a realistic view of endocrine therapy, imagination-training to integrate positive aspects of medication into daily life, and side-effect management to enhance expectations about coping ability. <outcome-Measure>Side effects three months after the start of endocrine therapy</outcome-Measure> serve as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include <outcome-Measure>quality of life</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>coping ability</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>patients' medication adherence</outcome-Measure>. <outcome-Measure>Patients' expectations</outcome-Measure> (i.e., expectations about side effects, coping ability, treatment and illness) are analyzed as mediators. The optimization of expectations might be a potential pathway in health care to improve patients' quality of life during long-term medication intake. The results will provide implications for a possible integration of evidence-based prevention training into clinical practice. ClinicalTrials.gov, (NCT01741883).
