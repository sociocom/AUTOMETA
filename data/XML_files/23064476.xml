Efficacy of a combined <intervention>alendronate</intervention> and <intervention>calcitriol agent</intervention> (Maxmarvil®) in <ethinicity>Korean</ethinicity> postmenopausal women with early breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The use of aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive early breast cancer (EBC) produces a deleterious effect on bone mass and an increase in fractures. Several studies using intravenous bisphosphonates have shown effective management of AI-induced bone loss. To determine whether a lower dosage in oral form combined with calcitriol can effectively manage <condition>AI-induced bone loss</condition>, we performed a randomized, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled <duration>24-week</duration> trial with a combination of alendronate and 0.5-µg of calcitriol daily to HR-positive EBC patients. A total of <No-of-participants>98</No-of-participants> <eligibility>Korean postmenopausal women with HR-positive EBC</eligibility> who received daily AI, calcium and vitamin D were randomly assigned to 5-mg of alendronate and 0.5-µg of calcitriol (Maxmarvil®) or <control>placebo</control> groups. The <outcome-Measure>bone mineral density (BMD)</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>turnover markers</outcome-Measure> were measured. At week 24, the <outcome>difference in lumbar BMD</outcome> between the groups was 3.0% (p &lt; 0.005). The <outcome>increase in C-telopeptide</outcome> after 24 weeks was significantly less in the Maxmarvil group compared to that in the placebo group (35.2 ± 17.5% vs. 109.8 ± 28.6%, p &lt; 0.05). Our study demonstrates that a combination of 5-mg alendronate and 0.5-µg calcitriol is effective to prevent bone loss due to AI in Korean postmenopausal women with EBC.
