<intervention>Meat intake</intervention>, methods and degrees of cooking and breast cancer risk in the MCC-Spain study. To analyse the relationship of the risk of breast cancer (BC) to meat intake, preference regarding degree of cooking ('doneness') and cooking methods, using data from a population-based case-control study (MCC-Spain). <intervention-participants>1006</intervention-participants> Histologically confirmed incident BC cases and <control-participants>1370</control-participants> <control>controls</control> were recruited in <location>10 Spanish provinces</location>. Participants were <average-age>23-85 years</average-age> old. They answered an <outcome-Measure>epidemiological survey</outcome-Measure> and a <outcome-Measure>food frequency questionnaire</outcome-Measure>. BC risk was assessed overall, by menopausal status and by pathological subtypes, using logistic and multinomial regression mixed models adjusted for known confounding factors and including province as a random effects term. Breast cancer and pathological subtype. <outcome>High total intake of meat</outcome> (ORQ4-Q1 (95% IC) = 1.39 (1.03-1.88)) was associated with <outcome>increased BC risk</outcome> among post-menopausal women. Similar results were found for p&lt;utcome>rocessed/cured meat</outcome> (ORQ4-Q1 (95% IC) = 1.47 (1.10-1.97)), and this association was particularly strong for triple-negative tumours (ER-, PR- and HER2-) (ORQ4-Q1 (95% IC) = 2.52 (1.15-5.49)). <outcome>Intakes of well-done</outcome> (ORwell-donevsrare (95% CI) = 1.62 (1.15-2.30)) and stewed (OR (95% CI) = 1.49 (1.20-1.84)) red meat were associated with <outcome>increased BC risk</outcome>, with a high risk observed for HR+ tumours (ER+/PR+ and HER2-). <outcome>Pan-fried/bread-coated fried white meat, but not doneness preference</outcome>, was associated with an <outcome>increased BC</outcome> risk for all women (OR (95% CI) = 1.38 (1.14-1.65)), with a stronger association for pre-menopausal women (OR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.29-2.46)). The risk of developing BC could be reduced by moderating the consumption of well-done or stewed red meat, pan-fried/bread-coated fried white meat and, especially, processed/cured meat.
