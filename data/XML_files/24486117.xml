Prophylactic use of <intervention>Mepitel Film</intervention> prevents <condition>radiation-induced moist desquamation</condition> in an intra-patient randomised controlled clinical trial of <No-of-participants>78</No-of-participants> breast cancer patients. Safetac-based soft silicone dressings used in a management setting decrease the severity of radiation-induced acute skin reactions but do not affect moist desquamation rates. Here we investigate the prophylactic use of another Safetac product, Mepitel Film, on moist desquamation rates. A total of <No-of-participants>80</No-of-participants> <eligibility>breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy</eligibility> were recruited <duration>between October 2012 and April 2013</duration>; <No-of-participants>78</No-of-participants> participants contributed data for analysis. Lateral and medial halves of the skin areas to be irradiated were randomised to Mepitel Film or <control>aqueous cream</control>; skin dose was measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters; <outcome-Measure>skin reaction severity</outcome-Measure> was assessed using RISRAS and RTOG scales. Overall skin reaction severity was reduced by 92% (p&lt;.0001) in favour of Mepitel Film (RISRAS). All patients developed some form of <outcome>reaction in cream-treated skin</outcome> which progressed to moist desquamation in <control-value>26%</control-value> of patients (<outcome>RTOG grades I</outcome>: <control-value>28%</control-value>; <outcome>IIA</outcome>: <control-value>46%</control-value>; <outcome>IIB</outcome>: <control-value>18%</control-value>; <outcome>III</outcome>: <control-value>8%</control-value>). Only <intervention-value>44%</intervention-value> of patients had a <outcome>skin reaction</outcome> under the Film, which did not progress to moist desquamation in any of the patients (<outcome>RTOG grades I</outcome>: <intervention-value>36%</intervention-value>; <outcome>IIA</outcome>: <intervention-value>8%</intervention-value>). Mepitel Film completely prevented moist desquamation and reduced skin reaction severity by 92% when used prophylactically in our cohort.
