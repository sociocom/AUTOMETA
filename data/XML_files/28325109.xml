Feasibility and effects of a combined adjuvant high-intensity interval/strength training in breast cancer patients: a single-center pilot study. To evaluate feasibility of an exercise intervention consisting of high-intensity interval endurance and strength training in breast cancer patients. <No-of-participants>Twenty-six</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with nonmetastatic breast cancer</eligibility> were consecutively assigned to the <intervention>exercise</intervention> intervention- (n= <intervention-participants>15</intervention-participants>, mean age <average-age>51.9 ± 9.8 years</average-age>) and the <control>control group</control> (n = <control-participants>11</control-participants>, mean age <average-age>56.9 ± 7.0 years</average-age>). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing that included <outcome-Measure>lactate sampling</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>one-repetition maximum tests</outcome-Measure> and a <outcome-Measure>HADS-D questionnaire</outcome-Measure> were used to monitor patients both before and after a supervised six weeks period of either combined high-intensity interval endurance and strength training (intervention group, twice a week) or leisure training (control group). Contrarily to the control group, <outcome-Measure>endurance</outcome-Measure> (mean change of VO2, peak 12.0 ± 13.0%) and <outcome>strength performance</outcome> (mean change of cumulative load 25.9 ± 11.2%) and <outcome>quality of life</outcome> increased in the intervention group. No training-related <outcome>adverse events</outcome> were observed. Our guided exercise intervention could be used effectively for initiation and improvement of performance capacity and quality of life in breast cancer patients in a relatively short time. This might be especially attractive during medical treatment. Long-term effects have to be evaluated in randomized controlled studies also with a longer follow-up. Implications for Rehabilitation High-intensity interval training allows improvement of aerobic capacity within a comparable short time. Standard leisure training in breast cancer patients is rather suitable for the maintenance of performance capacity and quality of life. Guided high-intensity interval training combined with strength training can be used effectively for the improvement of endurance and strength capacity and also quality of life. After exclusion of contraindications, guided adjuvant high-intensity interval training combined with strength training can be safely used in breast cancer patients.
