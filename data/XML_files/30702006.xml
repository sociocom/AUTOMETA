Effect of <intervention>progressive resistance training</intervention> on health-related quality of life in the first year after breast cancer surgery - results from a randomized controlled trial. Aims: To examine the effect of progressive resistance training (PRT) on health related quality of life and a predefined symptom cluster of pain-sleep-fatigue. Methods: This study was a planned secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial examining the effect of PRT on prevention of arm lymphedema in a population of women between <average-age>18 and 75 years</average-age> <eligibility>undergoing breast cancer surgery with axillary lymph node dissection</eligibility>. Participants were allocated by computer randomization to <control>usual care control</control> or a PRT intervention in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention, initiated in the third post-operative week, consisted of three times PRT per week, supervised in groups in the first 20 weeks, and self-administered in the following 30 weeks. <outcome-Measure>Questionnaire assessments</outcome-Measure> were made at baseline, 20 weeks and 12 months, with the European Organization for Research and Treatment in Cancer Core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30) and the <outcome-Measure>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-(FACIT) fatigue questionnaire</outcome-Measure>. The <outcome-Measure>symptom cluster of pain-sleep-fatigue</outcome-Measure> was measured with a constructed score adding EORTC C30 subscales of insomnia, pain, and fatigue. Data were treated as repeated measurements and analyzed with mixed models. Results: Among <No-of-participants>158</No-of-participants> recruited participants, we found a clinically relevant <outcome>increased emotional functioning</outcome> with nine points <outcome>at both follow-ups</outcome> (p = .02), <outcome>and 16 and 11 points at 20 weeks and 12 months</outcome> respectively (p = .04) in social functioning. Furthermore, in the subgroup of women with the symptom cluster pain-sleep-fatigue present at baseline, a significant effect was found for <outcome>global health status</outcome> (p = .01) and <outcome>social functioning</outcome> (p = .02). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to report clinically relevant effects of PRT on social and emotional functioning in the first postoperative year after breast cancer surgery. Furthermore, a subgroup of women with the pain-sleep-fatigue symptom cluster had particular benefit from PRT on global health status and social functioning.
