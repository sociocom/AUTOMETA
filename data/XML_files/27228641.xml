<intervention>Melatonin</intervention> for Prevention of Breast <condition>Radiation Dermatitis</condition>: A Phase II, Prospective, Double-Blind Randomized Trial. Radiation-induced dermatitis is commonly seen during radiotherapy for breast cancer. Melatonin-based creams have shown a protective effect against ultraviolet-induced erythema and a radioprotective effect in rats. To evaluate the efficacy of melatonin-containing cream in minimizing acute radiation dermatitis. In this phase II, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study, <eligibility>patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery for stage 0-2 breast cancer</eligibility> were randomly allocated to melatonin emulsion (<intervention-participants>26</intervention-participants> women) or <control>placebo</control> (<control-participants>21</control-participants> women) for twice daily use during radiation treatment and <duration>2 weeks</duration> following the end of radiotherapy. All women received 50 Gy whole breast radiation therapy with 2 Gy/fx using computed tomography-based 3D planning. Patients were examined and completed a detailed questionnaire weekly and 2 weeks following the end of treatment. The occurrence of <outcome>grade 1/2 acute radiation dermatitis</outcome> was significantly lower (<intervention-value>59%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>90%</control-value>, P = 0.038) in the melatonin group. Women older than 50 had significantly less <outcome>dermatitis</outcome> than younger patients (56% vs. 100%, P = 0.021). The <outcome>maximal radiation dermatitis</outcome> in the study group was grade 2 in <intervention-value>15%</intervention-value> of the treated patients. Patients treated with melatonin-containing emulsion experienced significantly reduced radiation dermatitis compared to patients receiving placebo.
