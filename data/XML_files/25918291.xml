Effect of Low-Intensity <intervention>Physical Activity</intervention> and Moderate- to High-Intensity <intervention>Physical Exercise</intervention> During Adjuvant Chemotherapy on Physical Fitness, Fatigue, and Chemotherapy Completion Rates: Results of the PACES Randomized Clinical Trial. We evaluated the effectiveness of a low-intensity, home-based physical activity program (Onco-Move) and a moderate- to high-intensity, combined supervised resistance and aerobic exercise program (OnTrack) versus <control>usual care (UC)</control> in maintaining or enhancing physical fitness, minimizing fatigue, enhancing health-related quality of life, and optimizing chemotherapy completion rates in <eligibility>patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer</eligibility>. We randomly assigned patients who were scheduled to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy (N = <No-of-participants>230</No-of-participants>) to Onco-Move, OnTrack, or UC. Performance-based and self-reported outcomes were assessed before random assignment, at the end of chemotherapy, and at the 6-month follow-up. We used generalized estimating equations to compare the groups over time. Onco-Move and OnTrack resulted in <outcome>less decline in cardiorespiratory fitness</outcome> (P &lt;.001), <outcome>better physical functioning</outcome> (P â‰¤ .001), <outcome>less nausea and vomiting</outcome> (P = .029 and .031, respectively) and <outcome>less pain</outcome> (P = .003 and .011, respectively) compared with UC. OnTrack also resulted in <outcome>better outcomes for muscle strength</outcome> (P = .002) and <outcome>physical fatigue</outcome> (P &lt;.001). At the 6-month follow-up, most outcomes returned to baseline levels for all three groups. A smaller percentage of participants in OnTrack required <outcome>chemotherapy dose adjustments</outcome> than those in the UC or Onco-Move groups (P = .002). Both intervention groups returned earlier (P = .012), as well as for more hours per week (P = .014), to work than the control group. A supervised, moderate- to high-intensity, combined resistance and aerobic exercise program is most effective for patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. A home-based, low-intensity physical activity program represents a viable alternative for women who are unable or unwilling to follow the higher intensity program.
