NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic <intervention>naproxen</intervention> or <intervention>loratadine</intervention> vs <control>no prophylactic treatment</control> on <condition>bone pain</condition> in <eligibility>patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim</eligibility>. Mild-to-moderate bone pain is a commonly reported adverse event (AE) associated with pegfilgrastim. We evaluated the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain. In this open-label study (NCT01712009), women <average-age>≥ 18 years</average-age> of age <eligibility>with newly diagnosed stage I-III breast cancer and an ECOG performance status ≤ 2 who were planning ≥ 4 cycles of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with pegfilgrastim support starting in cycle 1 were randomized 1:1:1 to receive naproxen, loratadine, or no treatment to prevent pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain</eligibility>. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>all-grade bone pain in cycle 1 from AE reporting</outcome-Measure>. Secondary endpoints included <outcome-Measure>bone pain in cycles 2-4 and across all cycles from AE reporting</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>patient-reported bone pain by cycle and across all cycles</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>Six hundred</No-of-participants> patients were enrolled. Most patients (83.0%) were <ethinicity>white</ethinicity>, and mean (SD) age was <average-age>54.2 (11.1) years</average-age>. The <outcome>percentage of patients with all-grade bone pain in cycle 1 from AE reporting</outcome> in the naproxen, loratadine, and no prophylaxis groups was <intervention-value>40.3</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>42.5</intervention-value>, and <control-value>46.6%</control-value>, respectively; differences between the treatment groups were not statistically significant. Maximum, mean, and area under the curve for <outcome>patient-reported bone pain</outcome> were consistently lower in the naproxen and loratadine groups than in the no prophylaxis group; some of these differences were significant. Loratadine was associated with fewer <outcome>treatment-related AEs and discontinuations</outcome> than naproxen. Given its tolerability, its ease of administration, and its potential benefit, treatment with loratadine should be considered to help prevent bone pain in patients receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim.
