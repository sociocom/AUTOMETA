Advantages with prophylactic <intervention>PEG-rhG-CSF</intervention> versus <control>rhG-CSF</control> in <eligibility>breast cancer patients receiving multiple cycles of myelosuppressive chemotherapy</eligibility>: an open-label, randomized, multicenter phase III study. PEG-rhG-CSF reduces neutropenia and improves chemotherapy safety. In <location>China's</location> registration trial (CFDA: 2006L01305), we assessed its efficacy and safety against rhG-CSF, and prospectively explored its value over multiple cycles of chemotherapy. In this open-label, randomized, multicenter phase 3 study, breast cancer patients (n = <No-of-participants>569</No-of-participants>) were randomized to receive PEG-rhG-CSF 100 µg/kg, PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg, or rhG-CSF 5 µg/kg/d after chemotherapy. The primary endpoints were the <outcome-Measure>incidence and duration of grade 3/4 neutropenia during cycle 1</outcome-Measure>. Secondary endpoints included the <outcome-Measure>incidence and duration of grade 3/4 neutropenia during cycles 2-4</outcome-Measure>, the <outcome-Measure>incidence of febrile neutropenia</outcome-Measure>, and the <outcome-Measure>safety</outcome-Measure>. A once-per-cycle PEG-rhG-CSF at either 100 µg/kg or 6 mg was not different from daily injections of rhG-CSF for either incidence or duration of grade 3/4 neutropenia. Interestingly, a substantial difference was noted during cycle 2, and the difference became bigger over cycles 3-4, reaching a statistical significance at cycle 4 in either incidence (P = 0.0309) or duration (P = 0.0289) favoring PEG-rhG-CSF. A significant trend toward a lower <outcome>incidence of all-grade adverse events</outcome> was noted at <intervention-value>129</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>68.98%</intervention-value>), <intervention-value>142</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>75.53%</intervention-value>), and <control-value>160</control-value> (<control-value>82.47%</control-value>) in the PEG-rhG-CSF 100 µg/kg and 6 mg and rhG-CSF groups, respectively (P = 0.0085). The corresponding <outcome>incidence of grade 3/4 drug-related adverse events</outcome> was <intervention-value>2</intervention-value>/<intervention-participants>187</intervention-participants> (<intervention-value>1.07%</intervention-value>), <intervention-value>1</intervention-value>/<intervention-participants>188</intervention-participants> (<intervention-value>0.53%</intervention-value>), and <control-value>8</control-value>/<control-participants>194</control-participants> (<control-value>4.12%</control-value>), respectively (P = 0.0477). Additionally, PFS in metastatic patients preferred PEG-rhG-CSF to rhG-CSF despite no significance observed by Kaplan-Meier analysis (n = 49, P = 0.153). PEG-rhG-CSF is a more convenient and safe formulation and a more effective prophylactic measure in breast cancer patients receiving multiple cycles of chemotherapy.
