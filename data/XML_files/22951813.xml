Pain outcomes in patients with advanced breast cancer and bone metastases: results from a randomized, double-blind study of denosumab and zoledronic acid. In this study, the authors evaluated the effect of <intervention>denosumab</intervention> versus <control>zoledronic acid (ZA)</control> on <condition>pain</condition> in <eligibility>patients with advanced breast cancer and bone metastases</eligibility>. The prevention of pain, reduction in pain interference with daily life activities, and the proportion of patients requiring strong opioid analgesics were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy phase 3 study comparing denosumab with ZA for preventing skeletal-related events in <No-of-participants>2046</No-of-participants> patients who had breast cancer and bone metastases. Patients completed the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form at baseline and monthly thereafter. Fewer patients who received denosumab reported a clinically meaningful worsening of <outcome>pain severity</outcome> (â‰¥2-point increase) from baseline compared with patients who received ZA, and a trend was observed toward delayed time to pain worsening with denosumab versus ZA (denosumab, 8.5 months; ZA, 7.4 months; P = .08). In patients who had no/mild pain at baseline, a <outcome>4-month delay in progression to moderate/severe pain</outcome> was observed with denosumab compared with ZA (9.7 months vs 5.8 months; P = .002). Denosumab delayed the <outcome>time to increased pain interference</outcome> by approximately 1 month compared with ZA (denosumab, 16.0 months; ZA, 14.9 months; P = .09). The <outcome>time to pain improvement</outcome> (P = .72) and the <outcome>time to decreased pain interference</outcome> (P = .92) were similar between the groups. Fewer denosumab-treated patients reported increased <outcome>analgesic use</outcome> from no/low use at baseline to strong opioid use. Denosumab demonstrated improved pain prevention and comparable pain palliation compared with ZA. In addition, fewer denosumab-treated patients shifted to strong opioid analgesic use.
