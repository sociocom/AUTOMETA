<intervention>Carvedilol</intervention> for Prevention of <condition>Chemotherapy-Related Cardiotoxicity</condition>: The CECCY Trial. Anthracycline (ANT) chemotherapy is associated with cardiotoxicity. Prevention with β-blockers remains controversial. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study sought to evaluate the role of carvedilol in preventing ANT cardiotoxicity. The authors randomized <No-of-participants>200</No-of-participants> <eligibility>patients with HER2-negative breast cancer tumor status and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) referred for ANT (240 mg/m2)</eligibility> to receive carvedilol or <control>placebo</control> until chemotherapy completion. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>prevention of a ≥10% reduction in LVEF at 6 months</outcome-Measure>. Secondary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>effects of carvedilol on troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and diastolic dysfunction</outcome-Measure>. <outcome>Primary endpoint</outcome> occurred in <intervention-value>14</intervention-value> patients (<intervention-value>14.5%</intervention-value>) in the carvedilol group and <control-value>13</control-value> patients (<control-value>13.5%</control-value>) in the placebo group (p = 1.0). No differences in <outcome>changes of LVEF or B-type natriuretic peptide</outcome> were noted between groups. A significant <outcome>difference existed between groups in troponin I levels</outcome> over time, with lower levels in the carvedilol group (p = 0.003). Additionally, a lower <outcome>incidence of diastolic dysfunction</outcome> was noted in the carvedilol group (p = 0.039). A nonsignificant trend toward a less-pronounced <outcome>increase in LV end-diastolic diameter</outcome> during the follow-up was noted in the carvedilol group (44.1 ± 3.64 mm to 45.2 ± 3.2 mm vs. 44.9 ± 3.6 mm to 46.4 ± 4.0 mm; p = 0.057). In this largest clinical trial of β-blockers for prevention of cardiotoxicity under contemporary ANT dosage, the authors noted a 13.5% to 14.5% incidence of cardiotoxicity. In this scenario, carvedilol had no impact on the incidence of early onset of LVEF reduction. However, the use of carvedilol resulted in a significant reduction in troponin levels and diastolic dysfunction.
