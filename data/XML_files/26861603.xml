Observation versus late reintroduction of <intervention>letrozole</intervention> as adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (ANZ0501 LATER): an open-label randomised, controlled trial. Despite the effectiveness of adjuvant endocrine therapy in preventing breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer events continue at a high rate for at least 10 years after completion of therapy. This randomised open label phase III trial recruited <eligibility>postmenopausal women</eligibility> from 29 <location>Australian</location> and <location>New Zealand</location> sites, <eligibility>with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, who had completed ≥4 years of endocrine therapy</eligibility> [aromatase inhibitor (AI), tamoxifen, ovarian suppression, or sequential combination] ≥1 year prior, to oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily for <duration>5 years</duration>, or <control>observation</control>. Treatment allocation was by central computerised randomisation, stratified by institution, axillary node status and prior endocrine therapy. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>invasive breast cancer events</outcome-Measure> (new invasive primary, local, regional or distant recurrence, or contralateral breast cancer), analysed by intention to treat. The secondary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>disease-free survival (DFS)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>overall survival</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>safety</outcome-Measure>. <duration>Between 16 May 2007 and 14 March 2012</duration>, <intervention-participants>181</intervention-participants> patients were randomised to letrozole and <control-participants>179</control-participants> to observation (median age <average-age>64.3 years</average-age>). Endocrine therapy was completed at a median of 2.6 years before randomisation, and 47.5% had tumours of >2 cm and/or node positive. At 3.9 years median follow-up (interquartile range 3.1-4.8), <intervention-value>2</intervention-value> patients assigned letrozole (<intervention-value>1.1%</intervention-value>) and <control-value>17</control-value> patients assigned observation (<control-value>9.5%</control-value>) had experienced an <outcome>invasive breast cancer event</outcome> (difference 8.4%, 95% confidence interval 3.8% to 13.0%, log-rank test P = 0.0004). <control-value>Twenty-four</control-value> patients (<control-value>13.4%</control-value>) in the observation and <intervention-value>14</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>7.7%</intervention-value>) in the letrozole arm experienced a <outcome>DFS event</outcome> (log-rank P = 0.067). <outcome>Adverse events</outcome> linked to oestrogen depletion, but not serious adverse events, were more common with letrozole. These results should be considered exploratory, but lend weight to emerging data supporting longer duration endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, and offer insight into reintroduction of AI therapy.
