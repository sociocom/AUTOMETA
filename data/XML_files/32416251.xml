Time course and management of key adverse events during the randomized phase III SOLAR-1 study of <intervention>PI3K inhibitor alpelisib</intervention> plus <intervention>fulvestrant</intervention> in <eligibility>patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer</eligibility>. Alpelisib (α-selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) plus fulvestrant is approved in multiple countries for men and postmenopausal women with PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer following progression on or after endocrine therapy. A detailed understanding of alpelisib's safety profile should inform adverse event (AE) management and enhance patient care. AEs in the phase III SOLAR-1 trial were assessed in patients with and without PIK3CA mutations. The impact of protocol-specified AE-management recommendations was evaluated, including an amendment to optimize hyperglycemia and rash management. Patients were randomly assigned to receive fulvestrant plus alpelisib (n = <intervention-participants>284</intervention-participants>) or <control>placebo</control> (n = <control-participants>287</control-participants>). The most common <outcome>grade 3/4 AEs</outcome> with alpelisib were <outcome>hyperglycemia</outcome> (<outcome>grade 3</outcome>, 32.7%; <outcome>grade 4</outcome>, 3.9%), <outcome>rash</outcome> (<outcome>grade 3</outcome>, 9.9%), and <outcome>diarrhea</outcome> (<outcome>grade 3</outcome>, 6.7%). <outcome>Median time to onset of grade ≥3 toxicity</outcome> was 15 days (hyperglycemia, based on fasting plasma glucose), 13 days (rash), and 139 days (diarrhea). Metformin alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents was used by most patients (87.1%) with hyperglycemia. Preventive anti-rash medication resulted in lower <outcome>incidence</outcome> (<outcome>any grade</outcome>, <intervention-value>26.7%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>64.1%</control-value>) and <outcome>severity of rash</outcome> (grade 3, <intervention-value>11.6%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>22.7%</control-value>) versus no preventative medication. <outcome>Discontinuations due to grade ≥3 AEs</outcome> were lower following more-detailed AE management guidelines (<intervention-value>7.9%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>18.1%</control-value> previously). Patients with PIK3CA mutations had a median alpelisib dose intensity of 248 mg/day. <outcome>Median progression-free survival</outcome> with alpelisib was 12.5 and 9.6 months for alpelisib dose intensities of ≥248 mg/day and &lt;48 mg/day, respectively, compared with 5.8 months with placebo. Hyperglycemia and rash occurred early during alpelisib treatment, while diarrhea occurred at a later time point. Early identification, prevention, and intervention, including concomitant medications and alpelisib dose modifications, resulted in less severe toxicities. Reductions in treatment discontinuations and improved progression-free survival at higher alpelisib dose intensities support the need for optimal AE management. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT02437318.
