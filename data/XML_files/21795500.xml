The GISS trial: a phase II prevention trial of <intervention>screening plus goserelin, ibandronate</intervention>, versus <control>screening alone</control> in premenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer. Genetic testing for inherited mutations in breast cancer genes provides valuable information for disease prevention. Today, <eligibility>premenopausal women with increased risk for breast cancer</eligibility> have only limited nonsurgical options to reduce their risk. The GISS trial, a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase II trial, assessed the feasibility of a preventive treatment with goserelin and ibandronate for premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer. The primary endpoints were <outcome-Measure>refusal to undergo randomization</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>discontinuation of treatment</outcome-Measure>. <outcome-Measure>Safety and quality of life</outcome-Measure> were also evaluated. Between the years 2001 and 2003, <No-of-participants>31</No-of-participants> of 322 eligible women participated in the trial; <intervention-participants>15</intervention-participants> received goserelin/ibandronate plus screening, <control-participants>15</control-participants> screening only, and 1 withdrew her consent after randomization. The treatment duration was <duration>24 months</duration>. Here, mainly the results from the first 12 months were evaluated because of the low compliance thereafter. <adverse-effect>Hot flushes</adverse-effect>, <adverse-effect>headache</adverse-effect>, and <adverse-effect>vaginal dryness/discharge</adverse-effect> occurred more often in the goserelin arm. No difference was observed between the two arms in the <outcome>agreement to randomization</outcome>, compliance, or any other endpoints. <outcome>Acceptance of chemoprevention</outcome> with goserelin and ibandronate was low. Premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer should be better informed about chemoprevention through physician counseling and a more feasible study design (e.g., oral medication) should be provided. This is the first chemoprevention trial in premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer.
