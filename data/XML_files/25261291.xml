A randomized, double-blind, active control, multicenter, dose-finding study of <intervention>lipegfilgrastim (XM22)</intervention> in <eligibility>breast cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive therapy</eligibility>. This dose-ranging study was conducted to identify the optimal fixed dose of lipegfilgrastim compared with pegfilgrastim 6.0 mg for the provision of neutrophil support during myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. A phase 2 study was conducted in which <No-of-participants>208</No-of-participants> <eligibility>chemotherapy-naive patients</eligibility> were randomized to receive lipegfilgrastim 3.0, 4.5, or 6.0 mg or pegfilgrastim 6.0 mg. Study drugs were administered as a single subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle (doxorubicin/docetaxel on day 1 for four 3-week cycles). The primary outcome measure was <outcome-Measure>duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in cycle 1</outcome-Measure>. Patients treated with lipegfilgrastim experienced <outcome>shorter DSN in cycle 1 with higher doses</outcome>. The <outcome>mean DSN</outcome> was 0.76 days in the lipegfilgrastim 6.0-mg group and 0.87 days in the pegfilgrastim 6.0-mg group, with no significant differences between treatment groups. Treatment with lipegfilgrastim 6.0 mg was consistently associated with a <outcome>higher absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at nadir, shorter ANC recovery time, and a similar safety and tolerability profile</outcome> compared with pegfilgrastim. This phase 2 study demonstrated that lipegfilgrastim 6.0 mg is the optimal dose for patients with breast cancer and provides neutrophil support that is at least equivalent to the standard 6.0-mg fixed dose of pegfilgrastim.
