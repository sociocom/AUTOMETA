Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Biomarker Modulation Study of <intervention>Vitamin D</intervention> Supplementation in Premenopausal Women at High Risk for Breast Cancer (SWOG S0812). Observational studies have reported an inverse association between vitamin D intake and breast cancer risk. We examined whether vitamin D supplementation in high-risk premenopausal women reduces mammographic density (MD), an established breast cancer risk factor. We conducted a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in <eligibility>premenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer [5-year risk ≥ 1.67%, lifetime risk ≥ 20%, lobular carcinoma in situ, prior stage 0-II breast cancer, hereditary breast cancer syndrome, or high MD (heterogeneously/extremely dense)], with a baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] ≤ 32 ng/mL</eligibility>. Participants were randomized to <duration>12 months</duration> of vitamin D3 20,000 IU/week or matching <control>placebo</control>. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>change in MD from baseline to 12 months</outcome-Measure> using the Cumulus technique. Secondary endpoints included s<outcome-Measure>erial blood biomarkers [25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-binding protein-3] and MD change at 24 months</outcome-Measure>. Among <No-of-participants>208</No-of-participants> women randomized, median age was <average-age>44.6 years</average-age>, 84% were <ethinicity>white</ethinicity>, 33% had baseline 25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/mL, and 78% had high baseline MD. Comparing the active and placebo groups at 12 months, <outcome>MD changes</outcome> were small and did not significantly differ. <outcome>Mean MD changes at 12 and 24 months</outcome> were -0.3% and -1.2%, respectively, in the active arm and +1.5% and +1.6% with placebo (P > 0.05). We observed a <outcome>mean change in serum 25(OH)D</outcome> of +18.9 versus +2.8 ng/mL (P &lt;0.01) and <outcome>IGF-1</outcome> of -9.8 versus -1.8 ng/mL (P = 0.28), respectively. At 12 months, MD was positively correlated with serum IGF-1 and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 (P &lt;0.01). This trial does not support the use of vitamin D supplementation for breast cancer risk reduction.
