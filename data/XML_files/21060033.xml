<intervention>Denosumab</intervention> compared with <control>zoledronic acid</control> for the treatment of <condition>bone metastases</condition> in patients with advanced breast cancer: a randomized, double-blind study. This randomized study compared denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor Îº B (RANK) ligand, with zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing skeletal-related events (SREs) in <eligibility>patients with breast cancer with bone metastases</eligibility>. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg and intravenous placebo (n = <intervention-participants>1,026</intervention-participants>) or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg adjusted for creatinine clearance and subcutaneous placebo (n = <control-participants>1,020</control-participants>) every 4 weeks. All patients were strongly recommended to take daily calcium and vitamin D supplements. The primary end point was <outcome-Measure>time to first on-study SRE</outcome-Measure> (defined as pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression). Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying <outcome>time to first on-study SRE</outcome> (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.95; P = .01 superiority) and time to first and subsequent (multiple) on-study SREs (rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.89; P = .001). <outcome>Reduction in bone turnover markers</outcome> was greater with denosumab. <outcome>Overall survival, disease progression, and rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs</outcome> were similar between groups. An excess of <adverse-effect>renal AEs</adverse-effect> and <adverse-effect>acute-phase reactions</adverse-effect> occurred with zoledronic acid; <adverse-effect>hypocalcemia</adverse-effect> occurred more frequently with denosumab. <outcome>Osteonecrosis of the jaw</outcome> occurred infrequently (<intervention-value>2.0%</intervention-value>, denosumab; <control-value>1.4%</control-value>, zoledronic acid; P = .39). Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in <outcome>delaying or preventing SREs</outcome> in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone and was generally well tolerated. With the convenience of a subcutaneous injection and no requirement for renal monitoring, denosumab represents a potential treatment option for patients with bone metastases.
