Overview of the randomized trials of <intervention>radiotherapy</intervention> in <condition>ductal carcinoma in situ</condition> of the breast. Individual patient data were available for all four of the randomized trials that began before 1995, and that compared adjuvant radiotherapy vs <control>no radiotherapy</control> following breast-conserving surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). A total of <No-of-participants>3729</No-of-participants> women were eligible for analysis. Radiotherapy <outcome>reduced the absolute 10-year risk of any ipsilateral breast event</outcome> (ie, either recurrent DCIS or invasive cancer) by 15.2% (SE 1.6%, <intervention-value>12.9%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>28.1%</control-value> 2 P &lt;00001), and it was effective regardless of the age at diagnosis, extent of breast-conserving surgery, use of tamoxifen, method of DCIS detection, margin status, focality, grade, comedonecrosis, architecture, or tumor size. The proportional <outcome>reduction in ipsilateral breast events</outcome> was greater in older than in younger women (2P &lt;.0004 for difference between proportional reductions; 10-year absolute risks: <intervention-value>18.5%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>29.1%</control-value> at ages &lt;0 years, 10.8% vs 27.8% at ages â‰¥ 50 years) but did not differ significantly according to any other available factor. Even for women with negative margins and small low-grade tumors, the <outcome>absolute reduction in the 10-year risk of ipsilateral breast events</outcome> was 18.0% (SE 5.5, <intervention-value>12.1%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>30.1%</control-value>, 2P = .002). After 10 years of follow-up, there was, however, no significant effect on breast cancer mortality, mortality from causes other than breast cancer, or all-cause mortality.
