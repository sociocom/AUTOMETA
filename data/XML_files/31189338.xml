Randomized controlled trial of <intervention>supportive care</intervention> interventions to manage <condition>psychological distress</condition> and symptoms in <ethinicity>Latinas</ethinicity> with breast cancer and their informal caregivers. Objective: The purpose of this study was to test two <duration>2-month</duration> psychosocial interventions (Telephone Interpersonal Counseling [TIPC] and Supportive Health Education [SHE]) to improve quality of life (QOL) outcomes for Latinas with breast cancer and their informal caregivers. Methods: <No-of-participants>Two hundred and forty-one</No-of-participants> <eligibility>Latinas with breast cancer and their caregivers</eligibility> were assessed at baseline, immediately after the 2-month intervention, at 4 and 6 months after baseline. QOL outcomes were <outcome-Measure>psychological distress, symptoms and social support</outcome-Measure>. Results: Linear mixed effects models showed that for <outcome>cancer survivors at 2 months</outcome>, TIPC produced lower adjusted mean depression scores compared to SHE. At 4 months, SHE had <outcome>reduced total number of symptoms, global symptom distress, and social isolation</outcome> compared to TIPC. Only <outcome>total number of symptoms</outcome> was lower in SHE than in TIPC at 6 months. Among <outcome>caregivers at 2 months, total number of symptoms, global symptom distress, and anxiety were lower, and self-efficacy for symptom management was higher</outcome> in SHE compared to TIPC. <outcome>Caregiver depression was lower</outcome> in TIPC compared to SHE at 4 months. Conclusions: These telephone delivered interventions improved different outcomes. TIPC demonstrated superior benefits for depression management and SHE was more successful in anxiety and cancer-related symptom management.
