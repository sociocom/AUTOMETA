<intervention>Manual lymph drainage</intervention> may not have a preventive effect on the development of breast cancer-related lymphoedema in the long term: a randomised trial. What are the short-term and long-term preventive effects of manual lymph drainage (MLD), when used in addition to information and exercise therapy, on the development of lymphoedema after axillary dissection for breast cancer? Randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation, blinded assessors and intention-to-treat analysis. <eligibility>Adults undergoing unilateral dissection for breast cancer</eligibility> were recruited, with <intervention-participants>79</intervention-participants> allocated to the experimental group and <control-participants>81</control-participants> to the <control>control group</control>. The experimental group received guidelines about prevention of lymphoedema, exercise therapy and MLD. The control group received the same guidelines and exercise therapy, but no MLD. The interventions in both groups were delivered for 6 months. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>cumulative incidence of arm lymphoedema defined in four ways (≥200ml,≥2cm,≥5%, and≥10% increase)</outcome-Measure>, which represent the difference in arm volume or circumference between the affected and healthy sides compared with the difference before surgery. Secondary outcomes included <outcome-Measure>point prevalence of lymphoedema</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>change in arm volume difference</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>shoulder range of movement</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>quality of life</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>function</outcome-Measure>. <outcome>Incidence rates</outcome> were comparable between experimental and control groups at all follow-up measurements. Sixty months after surgery, the <outcome>cumulative incidence rate for the≥200ml definition</outcome> was <intervention-value>35%</intervention-value> for the experimental group versus <control-value>29%</control-value> for the control group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.54, p=0.45); <outcome>for the≥2cm definition</outcome> <intervention-value>35%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>38%</control-value> (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.45, p=0.73); <outcome>for the≥5% definition</outcome> <intervention-value>68%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>53%</control-value> (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.69, p=0.08) and <outcome>for the≥10% definition</outcome> <intervention-value>28%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>24%</control-value> (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.10, p=0.57). The secondary outcomes were comparable between the groups at most assessment points.
