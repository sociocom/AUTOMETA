Open-label randomized clinical trial of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with <intervention>paclitaxel followed by FEC</intervention> versus the combination of <control>paclitaxel and everolimus followed by FEC</control> in <eligibility>women with triple receptor-negative breast cancer</eligibility>â€ . Everolimus synergistically enhances taxane-induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in addition to demonstrating a direct antiproliferative activity. We aim to determine pharmacodynamics changes and response of adding everolimus to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Phase II study in patients with primary TNBC randomized to <intervention>T-FEC</intervention> (paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) i.v. weekly for 12 weeks, followed by <intervention>5-fluorouracil</intervention> 500 mg/m(2), <intervention>epirubicin</intervention> 100 mg/m(2), and <intervention>cyclophosphamide</intervention> 500 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for four cycles) versus <control>TR-FEC</control> (paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) i.v. and <control>everolimus</control> 30 mg PO weekly for 12 weeks, followed by <control>FEC</control>). Tumor samples were collected to assess molecular changes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, at baseline, 48 h, 12 weeks, and at surgery by reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA). Clinical end points included <outcome-Measure>12-week clinical response rate (12-week RR)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>pathological complete response (pCR)</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>toxicity</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>Sixty-two</No-of-participants> patients were registered, and <No-of-participants>50</No-of-participants> were randomized, <intervention-participants>27</intervention-participants> received T-FEC, and <control-participants>23</control-participants> received TR-FEC. Median age was <average-age>48 (range 31-75)</average-age>. There was <outcome>downregulation of the mTOR pathway</outcome> at 48 h in the TR-FEC arm. <outcome>Twelve-week RR by ultrasound</outcome> were <intervention-value>29.6%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>47.8%</control-value>, (P = 0.075), and <outcome>pCR</outcome> were <intervention-value>25.9%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>30.4%</control-value> (P = 0.76) for T-FEC and TR-FEC, respectively. mTOR downregulation at 48 h did not correlate with 12-week RR in the TR-FEC group (P = 0.58). Main NCI grade 3/4 toxicities included <adverse-effect>anemia</adverse-effect>, <adverse-effect>neutropenia</adverse-effect>, <adverse-effect>rash/desquamation</adverse-effect>, and <adverse-effect>vomiting</adverse-effect> in both arms. There was <control-value>one</control-value> case of <outcome>grade 3 pneumonitis</outcome> in the TR-FEC arm. <outcome>No grade 3/4 stomatitis</outcome> occurred. The addition of everolimus to paclitaxel was well tolerated. Everolimus downregulated mTOR signaling but downregulation of mTOR at 48 h did not correlate with 12-week RR in the TR-FEC group.
