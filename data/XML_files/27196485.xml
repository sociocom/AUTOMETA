Preventive Analgesic Efficacy of <intervention>Nefopam</intervention> in <condition>Acute and Chronic Pain</condition> After Breast Cancer Surgery: A Prospective, Double-Blind, and Randomized Trial. Breast cancer surgery is known to cause severe acute postoperative pain, which can persist for a long time. We administered nefopam preventively to <eligibility>patients undergoing lumpectomy with axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy</eligibility>, and evaluated its efficacy on acute and chronic postoperative pain. Enrolled patients were assigned to the nefopam (n = <intervention-participants>41</intervention-participants>) or the <control>control</control> (n = <control-participants>42</control-participants>) group. Before initiating the operation, 20 mg of nefopam was given to the patients of the nefopam group, and <control>normal saline</control> was used in the control group. Ketorolac was given at the end of surgery, and meloxicam was prescribed in the postoperative period to all patients in both groups. <outcome-Measure>Pain</outcome-Measure> was assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS), and the rescue analgesic drug was given when the NRS was >5. Implementation of postoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy (RT), or hormone therapy was evaluated. The <outcome>NRS of postoperative pain</outcome> was significantly lower in the nefopam than in the control group in the postanesthetic care unit (4.5 ± 2.2 vs 5.7 ± 1.5, respectively; P = 0.01), <outcome>at postoperative 6 h</outcome> (3.0 ± 1.6 vs 4.5 ± 1.3, respectively; P &lt;0.001), and <outcome>at postoperative 24 h</outcome> (3.1 ± 1.1 vs 3.8 ± 1.5, respectively; P = 0.01) with reduced use of rescue analgesic drugs. Significantly fewer patients suffered from <outcome>chronic postoperative pain</outcome> in the nefopam than in the control group at postoperative 3 months (<intervention-value>36.6%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>59.5%</control-value>, P = 0.04). Considering only the cohort without postoperative adjuvant RT, the difference in the <outcome>proportion of patients reporting chronic pain</outcome> increased (<intervention-value>23.5%</intervention-value> in the nefopam group vs <control-value>61.5%</control-value> in the control group, P = 0.04). Preventive nefopam was helpful in reducing the acute postoperative pain, with reduced use of rescue analgesic drugs, and it contributed to reduced occurrence of chronic pain at postoperative 3 months after breast cancer surgery.
