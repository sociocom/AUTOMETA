Emulsion of <intervention>Olive Oil</intervention> and <intervention>Calcium Hydroxide</intervention> for the Prevention of <condition>Radiation Dermatitis</condition> in Hypofractionation Post-Mastectomy Radiotherapy: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Most of the patients who have been treated by post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) experience skin toxicity. There have been few studies on acute radiation dermatitis in <eligibility>breast cancer patients who received hypofractionation PMRT</eligibility>. <No-of-participants>62</No-of-participants> patients were randomized to receive a <control>general skin care regimen</control> with or without the addition of an emulsion of olive oil and calcium hydroxide twice a day, from the initiation of PMRT to 2 weeks after radiotherapy. <outcome-Measure>Adverse skin reactions and the Skindex-16 score</outcome-Measure> were assessed. <outcome>At the 8th, 13th, and 16th fraction of PMRT, grade 1 dermatitis</outcome> was found in <control-value>42</control-value>, <control-value>90</control-value>, and <control-value>90%</control-value> of the control group and in <intervention-value>16</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>30</intervention-value>, and <intervention-value>71%</intervention-value> of the intervention group. At the end of the study, the <outcome>mean Skindex-16 score</outcome> of the intervention group was significantly better than that of the control group (p = 0.019). Addition of an emulsion of olive oil and calcium hydroxide for patients undergoing hypofractionation PMRT yielded superior preventive results over a general skin care regimen alone, in terms of delaying skin toxicity, reducing the severity of acute radiation dermatitis, and a better quality of life in the intervention group. However, a larger number of patients will be required to confirm this result.
