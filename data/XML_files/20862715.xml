Randomized clinical trial of Chinese herbal medications to reduce <condition>wound complications</condition> after mastectomy for breast carcinoma. Ischaemia and necrosis of skin flaps is a common complication after mastectomy. This study evaluated the influence of <intervention>anisodamine</intervention> and <intervention>Salvia miltiorrhiza</intervention> on wound complications after mastectomy for breast cancer. <No-of-participants>Ninety</No-of-participants> <eligibility>patients undergoing mastectomy for breast carcinoma</eligibility> were divided into three groups. Group 1 received <control>routine wound care</control>, group 2 received intravenous Salvia miltiorrhiza after surgery for 3 days and group 3 similarly received intravenous anisodamine. <outcome-Measure>Skin flaps</outcome-Measure> were observed on postoperative days 4 and 8; areas of wound ischaemia and necrosis were graded and adverse events recorded. There was no difference in demographic characteristics between the groups. At 4 days after surgery the <outcome>rate of ischaemia and necrosis</outcome> in groups 2 and 3 was significantly reduced compared with that in control group 1 (median wound score <intervention-value>6·80</intervention-value> versus <control-value>23·38</control-value>, P = 0·002, and <intervention-value>3·76</intervention-value> versus <control-value>23·38</control-value>, P &lt;0·001, respectively). This <outcome>improvement in groups 2 and 3 continued to postoperative day 8</outcome> (both P &lt;0·001), but wound scores at this stage were better in group 3 than in group 2 (<intervention-value>1·82</intervention-value> versus <intervention-value>6·92</intervention-value> respectively; P = 0·022). The <outcome>volume of wound drainage</outcome> was lower in group 3 than in group 1 (P = 0·004). The <outcome>incidence of adverse effects</outcome> was highest in group 3, and two patients in this group discontinued treatment. No significant <outcome>complications</outcome> were noted in group 2. Anisodamine and S. miltiorrhiza were both effective in reducing skin flap ischaemia and necrosis after mastectomy, although anisodamine was associated with a higher rate of adverse effects.
