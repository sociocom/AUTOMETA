A <intervention>text message intervention</intervention> to support women's physical and mental health after breast cancer treatments (EMPOWER-SMS): a randomised controlled trial protocol. Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women worldwide. In developed countries, 80-90% of women will survive five years after diagnosis but the transition from hospital-based care to health self-management and self-efficacy can be difficult. Text messaging programs offer a simple and proven way to provide support to people with chronic diseases. This study aims to test the effectiveness of a text message support program at improving women's health self-efficacy, and physical and mental health outcomes after breast cancer treatments compared to <control>usual care</control> at <duration>6-months</duration> and to understand the barriers and enablers to widespread implementation. Single-blind randomised control trial (RCT; N = <No-of-participants>160</No-of-participants>) comparing a text message support intervention to usual care in <eligibility>women with breast cancer</eligibility> (recruited from a large tertiary referral hospital in <location>Sydney, Australia</location>). The intervention group will receive a six-month text message support program, which consists of semi-personalised, supportive, lifestyle-focused text messages (4 messages/week) in addition to usual care. The control group will receive usual care without the text message program. Outcomes will be assessed at 6-months. The primary outcome is <outcome-Measure>change in self-efficacy for managing chronic disease</outcome-Measure>. Secondary outcomes include <outcome-Measure>change in clinical outcomes (body mass index), lifestyle outcomes (physical activity levels, dietary behaviours), mood (depression and anxiety scales), quality of life, satisfaction with, and usefulness of the intervention</outcome-Measure>. Analyses will be performed on the principle of intention-to-treat to examine differences between intervention and control groups. This study will test if a scalable and cost-effective text-messaging intervention is effective at improving women's health self-efficacy, as well as physical and mental health outcomes. Moreover, this study will provide essential preliminary data to bolster a large multicentre RCT to helpsupport breast cancer survivors throughout recovery and beyond.
