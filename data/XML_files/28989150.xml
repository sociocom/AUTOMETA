[<intervention>Parecoxib</intervention> suppresses the increase of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio after the modified radical mastectomy]. To observe the effect of parecoxib on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)after the modified radical mastectomy, and to explore its potential mechanisms for inhibition of perioperative inflammation. Methods: A total of <No-of-participants>40</No-of-participants> <eligibility>breast cancer patients undergone the modified radical mastectomy</eligibility> were randomly divided into a parecoxib group (n=<intervention-participants>20</intervention-participants>) and a <control>control group</control> (n=<control-participants>20</control-participants>). The parecoxib group received intravenous parecoxib (40 mg, 5 mL) during general anesthesia induction, post-operative day 1 and day 2; the control group received intravenous normal saline (5 mL) at the corresponding time points. Their <outcome-Measure>peripheral bloods were collected for routine test in the morning of the surgery day (T1), and Day 1 (T2), Day 3 (T3) and Day 7 (T4) after the surgery,</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>NLR</outcome-Measure> was calculated. Results: Compared with T1, <outcome>NLR</outcome> in the control group at T2 and T3 was significantly increased (P&lt;.05), but not at T4 (P>0.05); NLR in the parecoxib group was sharply increased at T2 (P&lt;.01), and returned to preoperative levels at T3 and T4 (P>0.05). <outcome>NLR</outcome> in the parecoxib group was significantly lower than that in the control group at T2 (P&lt;.05), but there were no significant difference between the two groups at other time points (P>0.05). Conclusion: Parecoxib can restrain the inflammatory responses and improve immune function of the breast cancer patients by suppressing the elevation of NLR after the modified radical mastectomy, which is expected to improve the prognosis of the breast cancer patients.
