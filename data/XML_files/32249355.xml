Feasibility and efficacy of a <intervention>weight gain prevention</intervention> intervention for breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a randomized controlled pilot study. Weight gain is common among breast cancer patients and may contribute to poorer treatment outcomes. Most programs target breast cancer survivors after the completion of therapy and focus on weight reduction. This study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an intervention designed to prevent primary weight gain among women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. <No-of-participants>Thirty-eight</No-of-participants> <eligibility>newly diagnosed stage II or III breast cancer patients</eligibility> were randomized to the BALANCE intervention or <control>usual care</control> within 3 weeks of starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The intervention used a size acceptance-based approach and encouraged home-based resistance and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise as well as a low energy-dense diet to prevent weight gain. Assessments were conducted at baseline, mid-chemotherapy (3 months), and post-chemotherapy (6 months). <outcome-Measure>Intervention feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects on anthropometric, quality of life, and circulating biomarker measures</outcome-Measure> were evaluated. <outcome>Intervention participant retention</outcome> (100%) and <outcome>in-person session attendance</outcome> (80%) were high during the intervention period, although attendance dropped to 43% for telephone-delivered sessions. The majority of participants reported <outcome>being satisfied</outcome> with the intervention during chemotherapy (88%). Participants in the intervention group had greater <outcome>reductions in waist circumference</outcome> (p = .03) and greater <outcome>improvements in self-reported vitality scores</outcome> (p = .03) than the control group at the end of chemotherapy. Significant effects on biomarkers were not observed. A size acceptance weight management program is feasible during neoadjuvant chemotherapy among breast cancer patients and may have beneficial effects on waist circumference and patient vitality. This study was registered as a clinical trial at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00533338).
