"Randomised controlled trial of <intervention>scalp cooling</intervention> for the prevention of <condition>chemotherapy induced alopecia</condition>". Randomized controlled trials (RCT) of scalp cooling (SC) to prevent chemotherapy induced alopecia (CIA) did not evaluate its effect on hair regrowth (HR) and was conducted in a predominantly taxane (T) treated population. We conducted an RCT of SC in a setting of anthracycline (A) and taxane chemotherapy (CT) and assessed its effect on CIA and HR. <eligibility>Non-metastatic breast cancer women undergoing (neo) adjuvant CT</eligibility> were randomized to receive SC using the Paxman scalp cooling system during every cycle of CT, or <control>no SC</control>. The primary end point (PEP) was <outcome-Measure>successful hair preservation (HP) assessed clinically and by review of photographs after CT</outcome-Measure>. HR was assessed at 6 and 12 weeks. <No-of-participants>51</No-of-participants> patients were randomized to SC (<intervention-participants>34</intervention-participants>) or control arm (<control-participants>17</control-participants>) in a 2:1 ratio. Twenty-five (49%) patients received A followed by T and the two arms were balanced with respect to this factor. <outcome>HP rate</outcome> was significantly higher in SC arm compared to control arm (<intervention-value>56.3%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>0%</control-value>, P = 0.000004). <outcome>HR</outcome> was higher in SC arm compared to control <outcome>at 6 weeks</outcome> (<intervention-value>89%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>12%</control-value>; P &lt;0.001) and <outcome>12 weeks</outcome> (<intervention-value>100%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>59%</control-value>, P = 0.0003). <outcome>Loss of hair at PEP evaluation</outcome>, which was a quality of life measure, was significantly lower in SC versus control arm (<intervention-value>45%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>82%</control-value>, P = 0.016). There were <outcome>no grade 3-4 cold related adverse effects</outcome>. Women with breast cancer receiving A or T chemotherapy receiving SC were significantly more likely to have less than 50% hair loss after CT, superior hair regrowth and improvement in patient reported outcomes, with acceptable tolerance. It merits wider usage.
