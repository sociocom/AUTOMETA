Reducing persistent <condition>postoperative pain</condition> and disability 1 year after breast cancer surgery: a randomized, controlled trial comparing <intervention>thoracic paravertebral block</intervention> to <control>local anesthetic infiltration</control>. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) and local anesthetic (LA) on persistent postoperative pain (PPP) 1 year following breast cancer surgery. Secondary objectives were to compare the effect on arm morbidity and quality of life. <eligibility>Women scheduled for elective breast cancer surgery were randomly</eligibility> assigned to either TPVB or LA followed by general anesthesia. An NRS value of >3 at rest or with movement 1 year following surgery defined PPP. Blinded interim analysis suggested rates of PPP much lower than anticipated, making detection of the specified 20 % absolute reduction in the primary outcome impossible. Recruitment was stopped, and all enrolled patients were followed to <duration>1 year</duration>. A total of <No-of-participants>145</No-of-participants> participants were recruited; <intervention-participants>65</intervention-participants> were randomized to TPVB and <control-participants>64</control-participants> to LA. Groups were similar with respect to demographic and treatment characteristics. Only 9 patients (8 %; 95 % CI 4-14 %) met <outcome>criteria for PPP</outcome> 1 year following surgery; <intervention-value>5</intervention-value> were in the TPVB and <control-value>4</control-value> in the LA group. Brief <outcome>Pain Inventory severity and interference scores</outcome> were low in both groups. <outcome>Arm morbidity and quality of life</outcome> were similar in both groups. The 9 patients with PPP reported shoulder-arm morbidity and reduced quality of life. This study reports a low incidence of chronic pain 1 year following major breast cancer surgery. Although PPP was uncommon at 1 year, it had a large impact on the affected patients' arm morbidity and quality of life.
