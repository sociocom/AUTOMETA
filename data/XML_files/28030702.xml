Effect of <intervention>Longer-Interval</intervention> vs <control>Standard Dosing</control> of <intervention>Zoledronic Acid</intervention> on Skeletal Events in Patients With <condition>Bone Metastases</condition>: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Zoledronic acid, a third-generation aminobisphosphonate, reduces the incidence of skeletal-related events and pain in patients with bone metastases. The optimal dosing interval for zoledronic acid is uncertain. To determine whether zoledronic acid administered every 12 weeks is noninferior to zoledronic acid administered every 4 weeks. Randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted at 269 academic and community sites in the <location>United States</location>. Patients (n = <No-of-participants>1822</No-of-participants>) <eligibility>with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma who had at least 1 site of bone involvement</eligibility> were enrolled <duration>between May 2009 and April 2012</duration>; follow-up concluded in April 2014. Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid administered intravenously every 4 weeks (n = <control-participants>911</control-participants>) vs every 12 weeks (n = <intervention-participants>911</intervention-participants>) for <duration>2 years</duration>. The primary end point was the <outcome-Measure>proportion of patients having at least 1 skeletal-related event</outcome-Measure> (defined as clinical fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, or surgery involving bone) within 2 years after randomization and a between-group absolute difference of 7% as the noninferiority margin. Secondary end points included the <outcome-Measure>proportion of patients with at least 1 skeletal-related event by disease type</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>pain</outcome-Measure> as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (range, 0-10; higher scores indicate worse pain), <outcome-Measure>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status</outcome-Measure> (range, 0-4; higher scores indicate worse disability), <outcome-Measure>incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>kidney dysfunction</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>skeletal morbidity rate</outcome-Measure> (mean number of skeletal-related events per year), and, in a subset of 553 patients, <outcome-Measure>suppression of bone turnover</outcome-Measure> (assessed by C-terminal telopeptide levels). Among <No-of-participants>1822</No-of-participants> patients who were randomized (median age, <average-age>65 years</average-age>; 980 [53.8%] women; 855 with breast cancer, 689 with prostate cancer, and 278 with multiple myeloma), 795 completed the study at 2 years. A total of <control-participants>260</control-participants> patients (<control-value>29.5%</control-value>) in the zoledronic acid every 4-week dosing group and <intervention-participants>253</intervention-participants> patients (<intervention-value>28.6%</intervention-value>) in the every 12-week dosing group experienced at least 1 <outcome>skeletal-related event</outcome> within 2 years of randomization (risk difference of -0.3% [1-sided 95% CI, -4% to ∞]; P &lt;.001 for noninferiority). The proportions of skeletal-related events did not differ significantly between the every 4-week dosing group vs the every 12-week dosing group for patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma. <outcome>Pain scores, performance status scores, incidence of jaw osteonecrosis, and kidney dysfunction did not differ</outcome> significantly between the treatment groups. <outcome>Skeletal morbidity rates were numerically identical</outcome> in both groups, but bone turnover was greater (C-terminal telopeptide levels were higher) among patients who received zoledronic acid every 12 weeks. Among patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma, the use of zoledronic acid every 12 weeks compared with the standard dosing interval of every 4 weeks did not result in an increased risk of skeletal events over 2 years. This longer interval may be an acceptable treatment option. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00869206.
