A Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase III Study of <intervention>Epoetin Alfa</intervention> Versus <control>Best Standard of Care</control> in <eligibility>Anemic Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Receiving Standard Chemotherapy</eligibility>. An open-label, noninferiority study to evaluate the impact of epoetin alfa (EPO) on tumor outcomes when used to treat anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. <eligibility>Women with hemoglobin â‰¤ 11.0 g/dL, receiving first- or second-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer</eligibility>, were randomly assigned to EPO 40,000 IU subcutaneously once a week or best standard of care. The primary end point was <outcome-Measure>progression-free survival (PFS)</outcome-Measure>. Secondary end points included <outcome-Measure>overall survival</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>time to tumor progression</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>overall response rate</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>RBC transfusions</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>thrombotic vascular events</outcome-Measure>. In <No-of-participants>2,098</No-of-participants> patients randomly assigned, <outcome>median PFS</outcome> (based on investigator-determined disease progression [PD]) was 7.4 months in both groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.089; 95% CI, 0.988 to 1.200); upper bound exceeded prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.15. <outcome>Median PFS</outcome> per independent review committee-determined PD was 7.6 months in both groups (HR, 1.028; 95% CI, 0.922 to 1.146); upper bound did not exceed prespecified noninferiority margin. <outcome>Median overall survival at clinical cutoff</outcome> (1,337 deaths) was 17.2 months in the EPO and 17.4 months in the best standard of care group (HR, 1.057; 95% CI, 0.949 to 1.177), <outcome>median time to tumor progression</outcome> was 7.5 months in both groups (HR, 1.094; 95% CI, 0.991 to 1.209), and <outcome>overall response rate</outcome> was <intervention-value>50%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>51%</control-value> (odds ratio, 0.950; 95% CI, 0.799 to 1.130). <outcome>RBC transfusions</outcome> were <intervention-value>5.8%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>11.4%</control-value> (P &lt;.001), and <outcome>thrombotic vascular events</outcome> were <intervention-value>2.8%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>1.4%</control-value> (P = .038), respectively. The primary end point, PFS based on investigator-determined PD, did not meet noninferiority criteria. As a consistency assessment with the primary finding, PFS based on independent review committee-determined PD met noninferiority criteria. Overall, this study did not achieve noninferiority objective in ruling out a 15% increased risk in PD/death. RBC transfusion should be the preferred approach for the management of anemia in this population.
