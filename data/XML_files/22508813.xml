Prevention of <condition>pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain</condition>: a phase III double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of the university of rochester cancer center clinical community oncology program research base. Pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain is a significant clinical problem that may result in discontinuation of pegfilgrastim and lead to less effective chemotherapy dosing. Interventions for pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain are needed. The University of Rochester Cancer Center Clinical Community Oncology Program Research Base randomly assigned <No-of-participants>510</No-of-participants> patients at 17 sites to receive either <intervention>naproxen</intervention> (500 mg two times per day) or <control>placebo</control> on the day of pegfilgrastim administration, continuing for 5 to 8 days after pegfilgrastim. Patients recorded pain severity (using a scale of 0 to 10) and duration in daily diaries. The primary outcome measure was the <outcome-Measure>area under the curve (AUC) for pain for days 1 through 5</outcome-Measure>. Secondary outcome measures included the identification of <outcome-Measure>risk factors for the development of pain</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>response to naproxen</outcome-Measure>. Patients' mean age was <average-age>55.6 years</average-age> and 86% were female. Sixty-eight percent of patients had breast cancer and 10% had lung cancer. <outcome>Pain</outcome> reached its peak at 3 days for both groups. The <outcome>mean AUC for pain</outcome> was 7.71 for the placebo group and 6.04 for the naproxen group (P = .037). Naproxen reduced <outcome>maximum pain</outcome> from 3.40 to 2.59 (P = .005). Naproxen also reduced <outcome>overall pain incidence</outcome> from 71.3% to 61.1% (P = .020) and <outcome>duration</outcome> from 2.40 to 1.92 days (P = .009). The <outcome>reduction in severe pain</outcome> (> 5 on a scale of 1 to 10) from 27.0% to 19.2% was also significant (P = .048). Risk factors could not be identified to predict incidence, severity, or ability to prevent pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain. Our phase III randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated that naproxen at a dose of 500 mg twice per day is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain.
