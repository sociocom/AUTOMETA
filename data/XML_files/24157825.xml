The effect of <intervention>metformin</intervention> on <condition>apoptosis</condition> in a breast cancer presurgical trial. Metformin has been associated with antitumour activity in breast cancer (BC) but its mechanism remains unclear. We determined whether metformin induced a modulation of apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) overall and by insulin resistance status in a presurgical trial. Apoptosis was analysed in core biopsies and in surgical samples from <No-of-participants>100</No-of-participants> <eligibility>non-diabetic BC patients</eligibility> participating in a randomised trial of metformin vs <control>placebo</control> given for 4 weeks before surgery. <No-of-participants>Eighty-seven</No-of-participants> subjects (<intervention-participants>45</intervention-participants> on metformin and <control-participants>42</control-participants> on placebo) were assessable for TUNEL measurement at both time points. <outcome>TUNEL levels</outcome> at surgery were higher than that at baseline core biopsy (P&lt;.0001), although no difference between arms was noted (metformin arm: median difference surgery-biopsy levels +4%, interquartile range (IQR): 2-12; placebo arm: +2%, IQR: 0-8, P=0.2). <outcome>Ki67 labelling index and TUNEL levels</outcome> were directly correlated both at baseline and surgery (Spearman's r=0.51, P&lt;.0001). In the 59 women without insulin resistance (HOMA index&lt;.8) ,there was a higher <outcome>level of TUNEL at surgery</outcome> on metformin vs placebo (median difference on metformin +4%, IQR: 2-14 vs +2%, IQR: 0-7 on placebo), whereas an opposite trend was found in the 28 women with insulin resistance (median difference on metformin +2%, IQR: 0-6, vs +5%, IQR: 0-15 on placebo, P-interaction=0.1). Overall, we found no significant <outcome>modulation of apoptosis</outcome> by metformin, although there was a trend to a different effect according to insulin resistance status, with a pattern resembling Ki67 changes. Apoptosis was significantly higher in the surgical specimens compared with baseline biopsy and was directly correlated with Ki67. Our findings provide additional evidence for a dual effect of metformin on BC growth according to insulin resistance status.
