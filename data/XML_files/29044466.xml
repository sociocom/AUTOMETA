<intervention>Massage therapy</intervention> decreases <condition>cancer-related fatigue</condition>: Results from a randomized early phase trial. Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a prevalent and debilitating symptom experienced by cancer survivors, yet treatment options for CRF are limited. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of weekly <intervention>Swedish massage therapy (SMT)</intervention> versus an active control condition (light touch [LT]) and <control>waitlist control (WLC)</control> on persistent CRF in breast cancer survivors. This early phase, randomized, single-masked, 6-week investigation of SMT, LT, and WLC enrolled <No-of-participants>66</No-of-participants> <eligibility>female stage 0-III breast cancer survivors</eligibility> (age range, <average-age>32-72 years</average-age>) <eligibility>who had received surgery plus radiation and/or chemotherapy/chemoprevention with CRF (Brief Fatigue Inventory > 25)</eligibility>. The primary outcome was the <outcome-Measure>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)</outcome-Measure>, with the National Institutes of Health PROMIS Fatigue scale secondary. Mean baseline MFI scores for <No-of-participants>57</No-of-participants> evaluable subjects were 62.95 for SMT, 55.00 for LT, and 60.41 for WLC. SMT resulted in a mean (standard deviation) 6-week <outcome>reduction in MFI total scores</outcome> of -16.50 (6.37) (n = <intervention-participants>20</intervention-participants>) versus -8.06 (6.50) for LT (n = <control-participants>20</control-participants>) and an increase of 5.88 (6.48) points for WLC (n = 17) (treatment-by-time P &lt;.0001). The <outcome>mean baseline PROMIS Fatigue scores</outcome> were SMT, 22.25; LT, 22.05; and WLC, 23.24. The <outcome>mean (standard deviation) reduction in PROMIS Fatigue scores</outcome> was -5.49 (2.53) points for SMT versus -3.24 (2.57) points for LT and -0.06 (1.88) points for WLC (treatment-by-time P = .0008). Higher credibility, expectancy, and preference for SMT than for LT did not account for these results. SMT produced clinically significant relief of CRF. This finding suggests that 6 weeks of a safe, widely accepted manual intervention causes a significant reduction in fatigue, a debilitating sequela for cancer survivors.
