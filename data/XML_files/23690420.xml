<intervention>Lumpectomy</intervention> plus <intervention>tamoxifen</intervention> with or without <intervention>irradiation</intervention> in women age 70 years or older with early breast cancer: long-term follow-up of CALGB 9343. To determine whether there is a benefit to adjuvant radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery and tamoxifen in women age ≥ 70 years with early-stage breast cancer. <duration>Between July 1994 and February 1999</duration>, <No-of-participants>636</No-of-participants> women (age <average-age>≥ 70 years</average-age>) <eligibility>who had clinical stage I (T1N0M0 according to TNM classification) estrogen receptor (ER) -positive breast carcinoma treated by lumpectomy</eligibility> were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen plus radiation therapy (TamRT; <intervention-participants>317</intervention-participants> women) or <control>tamoxifen alone</control> (Tam; <control-participants>319</control-participants> women). Primary end points were <outcome-Measure>time to local or regional recurrence</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>frequency of mastectomy</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>breast cancer-specific survival</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>time to distant metastasis</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>overall survival (OS)</outcome-Measure>. Median follow-up for treated patients is now <duration>12.6 years</duration>. At 10 years, <intervention-value>98%</intervention-value> of patients receiving TamRT (95% CI, 96% to 99%) compared with <control-value>90%</control-value> of those receiving Tam (95% CI, 85% to 93%) were <outcome>free from local and regional recurrences</outcome>. There were no significant differences in <outcome>time to mastectomy, time to distant metastasis, breast cancer-specific survival, or OS</outcome> between the two groups. <outcome>Ten-year OS</outcome> was <intervention-value>67%</intervention-value> (95% CI, 62% to 72%) and <control-value>66%</control-value> (95% CI, 61% to 71%) in the TamRT and Tam groups, respectively. With long-term follow-up, the previously observed small improvement in locoregional recurrence with the addition of radiation therapy remains. However, this does not translate into an advantage in OS, distant disease-free survival, or breast preservation. Depending on the value placed on local recurrence, Tam remains a reasonable option for women age ≥ 70 years with ER-positive early-stage breast cancer.
