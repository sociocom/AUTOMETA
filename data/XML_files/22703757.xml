<intervention>Lanreotide Autogel</intervention> 90 mg and <condition>lymphorrhea</condition> prevention after axillary node dissection in breast cancer: a phase III double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Lanreotide Autogel 90 mg PR to prevent lymphorrhea after axillary dissection in breast cancer. A Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed <duration>between April 1st, 2008, and December 31st, 2010</duration>. The primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>lymphorrhea volume (ml) in the axillary drain during the first four postoperative days</outcome-Measure>. The secondary end points were the <outcome-Measure>number of days until axillary drain removal</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>hospital stay duration</outcome-Measure> (days), <outcome-Measure>lymphorrhea volume (ml) up to days 15, 30 and 180</outcome-Measure>, n<outcome-Measure>umber of cases with seroma aspiration</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>number of seroma aspirations</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>evaluation of wound, arm pain and mobility on days 15, 30 and 180</outcome-Measure>. A total of <No-of-participants>148</No-of-participants> patients were recruited for the study. Altogether <No-of-participants>145</No-of-participants> patients were randomized and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. On the day before surgery <control-participants>73</control-participants> patients received the <control>placebo</control> and <intervention-participants>72</intervention-participants> patients received lanreotide. At four postoperative days, there was a tendency towards a <outcome>reduction of the lymphorrhea volume</outcome> in the lanreotide group (median 292 ml, range 1-965 ml) as compared to the placebo group (median 337 ml, range 0-1230 ml), although it was not statistically significant (p = 0.18). There was <outcome>no significant difference for the secondary end points</outcome>. In the group with axillary dissection performed alone (n = 24), the <outcome>lymphorrhea volume</outcome> was shown to be significantly reduced in the lanreotide group, (p = 0.035) as compared to the placebo group. Our study did not identify any overall significant reduction of lymphorrhea on lanreotide.
