Prolonging the <intervention>duration of post-infusion scalp cooling</intervention> in the prevention of <condition>anthracycline-induced alopecia</condition>: a randomised trial in patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Scalp cooling as a method to reduce the incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is increasingly used in daily practice worldwide. However, in patients treated with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC), scalp cooling fails in 48-67% of patients. This study investigated the efficacy of extended duration of post-infusion scalp cooling in breast cancer patients treated with this regimen. In this prospective multi-centre randomised study, <No-of-participants>102</No-of-participants> <eligibility>patients with early breast cancer treated with adjuvant FEC chemotherapy</eligibility> were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a post-infusion cooling time of 90 or 150 min. The primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>need to wear a wig or other head covering to mask visible hair loss</outcome-Measure>. <control-value>Sixteen</control-value> out of <control-value>48</control-value> patients (<control-value>33%</control-value>) treated with <control>90 min of post-infusion cooling</control> <outcome>did not need any head covering</outcome>, compared with <intervention-value>21</intervention-value> out of <intervention-participants>46</intervention-participants> patients (<intervention-value>45%</intervention-value>) treated with 150 min of post-infusion cooling (p = 0.2). <outcome>WHO grades 2-3 (moderate-complete) alopecia</outcome> were reported more often in patients treated with 90-min post-infusion cooling time (n = <control-value>25</control-value>/<control-participants>51</control-participants> (<control-value>49%</control-value>) versus n = <intervention-value>17</intervention-value>/<intervention-participants>51</intervention-participants> (<intervention-value>33%</intervention-value>); p = 0,02). Scalp cooling was well-tolerated (mean Visual Analogue Score 7.4) and only three patients (3%) <adverse-effect>stopped due to intolerance</adverse-effect> during treatment. Extending the duration of 90-min post-infusion scalp cooling to 150 min in patients treated with adjuvant FEC chemotherapy was well-tolerated but did not significantly diminish the need for head covering. However, grades 2-3 alopecia was seen less often with prolonged post-infusion scalp cooling.
