Impact of a <intervention>primary care</intervention> based intervention on breast cancer knowledge, risk perception and concern: A randomized, controlled trial. To estimate the effects of a tablet-based, breast cancer risk education intervention for use in primary care settings (BreastCARE) on patients' breast cancer knowledge, risk perception and concern. <duration>From June 2011-August 2012</duration>, we enrolled women from two clinics, aged <average-age>40-74 years</average-age> <eligibility>with no personal breast cancer history</eligibility>, and randomized them to the BreastCARE intervention group or to the <control>control group</control>. All patients completed a baseline telephone survey and risk assessment (via telephone for controls, via tablet computer in clinic waiting room prior to visit for intervention). All women were categorized as high or average risk based on the Referral Screening Tool, the Gail model or the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium model. Intervention patients and their physicians received an individualized risk report to discuss during the visit. All women completed a follow-up telephone survey 1-2 weeks after risk assessment. Post-test comparisons estimated differences at follow-up in breast cancer knowledge, risk perception and concern. <intervention-participants>580</intervention-participants> intervention and <control-participants>655</control-participants> control women completed follow-up interviews. Mean age was <average-age>56 years</average-age> (SD = 9). At follow-up, <control-value>73%</control-value> of controls and <intervention-value>71%</intervention-value> of intervention women <outcome>correctly perceived their breast cancer risk</outcome> and <control-value>22%</control-value> of controls and <intervention-value>24%</intervention-value> of intervention women were very <outcome>concerned about breast cancer</outcome>. Intervention patients had greater <outcome>knowledge</outcome> (â‰¥75% correct answers) <outcome>of breast cancer risk factors</outcome> at follow-up (<intervention-value>24%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>16%</control-value>; p = 0.002). In multivariable analysis, there were no differences in correct risk perception or concern, but intervention patients had greater knowledge ([OR] = 1.62; 95% [CI] = 1.19-2.23). A simple, practical intervention involving physicians at the point of care can improve knowledge of breast cancer without increasing concern. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01830933.
