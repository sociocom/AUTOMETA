Effect of a <intervention>Scalp Cooling Device</intervention> on <condition>Alopecia</condition> in <eligibility>Women Undergoing Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer</eligibility>: The SCALP Randomized Clinical Trial. Chemotherapy may induce alopecia. Although scalp cooling devices have been used to prevent this alopecia, efficacy has not been assessed in a randomized clinical trial. To assess whether a scalp cooling device is effective at reducing chemotherapy-induced alopecia and to assess adverse treatment effects. Multicenter randomized clinical trial of women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Patients were enrolled <duration>from December 9, 2013, to September 30, 2016</duration>. One interim analysis was planned to allow the study to stop early for efficacy. Data reported are from the interim analysis. This study was conducted at 7 sites in the <location>United States</location>, and <No-of-participants>182</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with breast cancer requiring chemotherapy</eligibility> were enrolled and randomized. Participants were randomized to scalp cooling (n = <intervention-participants>119</intervention-participants>) or <control>control</control> (n = <control-participants>63</control-participants>). Scalp cooling was done using a scalp cooling device. The primary efficacy end points were <outcome-Measure>successful hair preservation</outcome-Measure> assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 scale (grade 0 [no hair loss] or grade 1 [&lt;0% hair loss not requiring a wig] were considered to have hair preservation) at the end of 4 cycles of chemotherapy by a clinician unaware of treatment assignment, and device safety. Secondary end points included <outcome-Measure>wig use</outcome-Measure> and scores on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer <outcome-Measure>Quality of Life</outcome-Measure> Questionnaire-Core 30, <outcome-Measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</outcome-Measure>, and a <outcome-Measure>summary scale of the Body Image Scale</outcome-Measure>. At the time of the interim analysis, <No-of-participants>142</No-of-participants> participants were evaluable. The mean (SD) age of the patients was <average-age>52.6 (10.1) years</average-age>; 36% (n = 51) received anthracycline-based chemotherapy and 64% (n = 91) received taxane-based chemotherapy. <outcome>Successful hair preservation</outcome> was found in <intervention-value>48</intervention-value> of <intervention-participants>95</intervention-participants> women with cooling (<intervention-value>50.5%</intervention-value>; 95% CI, 40.7%-60.4%) compared with <control-value>0</control-value> of <control-participants>47</control-participants> women in the control group (<control-value>0%</control-value>; 95% CI, 0%-7.6%) (success rate difference, 50.5%; 95% CI, 40.5%-60.6%). Because the 1-tailed P value from the Fisher exact test was <&lt;.001, which crossed the superiority boundary (P = .0061), the data and safety monitoring board recommended study termination on September 26, 2016. There were no statistically significant differences in <outcome>changes in any of the scales of quality of life</outcome> from baseline to chemotherapy cycle 4 among the scalp cooling and control groups. Only <outcome>adverse events</outcome> related to device use were collected; <control-value>54</control-value> adverse events were reported in the cooling group, all grades 1 and 2. There were no serious adverse device events. Among women with stage I to II breast cancer receiving chemotherapy with a taxane, anthracycline, or both, those who underwent scalp cooling were significantly more likely to have less than 50% hair loss after the fourth chemotherapy cycle compared with those who received no scalp cooling. Further research is needed to assess longer-term efficacy and adverse effects. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01986140.
