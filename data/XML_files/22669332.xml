Administration of <intervention>omega-3 fatty acids</intervention> and <intervention>Raloxifene</intervention> to women at high risk of breast cancer: interim feasibility and biomarkers analysis from a clinical trial. The antiestrogen, Raloxifene (Ral) is an effective breast cancer chemopreventive agent. Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3FA) may inhibit mammary carcinogenesis. On the basis of their mechanisms of action, we test the hypothesis that a combination of n-3FA and Ral may be superior in reducing select biomarkers of breast cancer risk in women. <eligibility>Postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer</eligibility> (breast density ≥ 25%) were randomized to: (1) <control>no intervention</control>; (2) Ral 60 mg; (3) Ral 30 mg; (4) n-3FA (Lovaza) 4 g and (5) Lovaza 4 g+Ral 30 mg for <duration>2 years</duration>. <outcome-Measure>Reduction in breast density</outcome-Measure> is the primary end point of the study. We report preliminary data on feasibility, compliance and changes in secondary end points related to IGF-I signaling, estrogen metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation in the first group of <No-of-participants>46</No-of-participants> women who completed 1 year of the study. <outcome>All interventions were well tolerated</outcome> with excellent compliance (96 ± 1% overall) by pill count and also supported by the expected rise in both serum n-3FA and n-3FA/Omega-6 fatty acids (n-6FA) ratio in women randomized to groups 4 and 5 (P&lt;.05). Lovaza decreased <outcome>serum triglycerides</outcome> and increased <outcome>high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol</outcome> compared with control (P&lt;.05 for both). Ral reduced <outcome>serum IGF-1</outcome> in a dose-dependent manner (P&lt;.05) while Lovaza did not. Lovaza had no effect on <outcome>IGF-1 or IGFBP-3</outcome>. None of the other biomarkers were affected by our treatment. The combination of Lovaza and Ral is a feasible strategy that may be recommended in future breast cancer chemoprevention trials.
