Prognostic effect of <intervention>circulating adiponectin</intervention> in a randomized 2 x 2 trial of low-dose <intervention>tamoxifen</intervention> and <intervention>fenretinide</intervention> in premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer. Adipokines are linked to obesity and insulin sensitivity and have recently been related to breast cancer risk and prognosis. We investigated the associations of plasma leptin and adiponectin with mammographic density and disease status and assessed their prognostic effect on recurrence-free survival in <eligibility>premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer</eligibility>. We measured <outcome-Measure>circulating lipids</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>insulin-like growth factor 1</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>glucose</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>insulin and insulin sensitivity</outcome-Measure> (calculated by homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] index), l<outcome-Measure>eptin</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>adiponectin</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>leptin-to-adiponectin ratio</outcome-Measure> in <No-of-participants>235</No-of-participants> <eligibility>premenopausal women with pT1mic/pT1a breast cancer (n = 21), intraepithelial neoplasia (n = 160), or 5-year Gail risk of 1.3% or greater</eligibility> (n = 54) who participated in a 2 Ã— 2 trial of low-dose tamoxifen, fenretinide, both agents, or <control>placebo</control> over a <duration>2-year</duration> period. At baseline, adiponectin levels were directly associated with <outcome>mammographic density and HDL cholesterol</outcome> and negatively associated with leptin, leptin-to-adiponectin ratio, body mass index (BMI), and HOMA index. Median <outcome>adiponectin levels</outcome> were lower in affected than in unaffected women (P = .006). After a median of <duration>7.2 years</duration> and total of 57 <outcome>breast neoplastic events</outcome>, there was a 12% reduction in the risk of breast neoplastic events per unit increase of adiponectin (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.96; P = .03). There was no interaction between treatment and <outcome>adiponectin levels</outcome>. Low adiponectin levels are associated with a history of prior intraepithelial neoplasia or pT1mic/pT1a breast cancer and higher risk of second breast neoplastic events in premenopausal women. The associations are independent of BMI, mammographic density, and treatment. Our findings support the role of adiponectin as a potential target for premenopausal breast cancer prevention and treatment.
