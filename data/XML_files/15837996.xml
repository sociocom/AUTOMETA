Efficacy and tolerability of <intervention>aprepitant</intervention> for the prevention of <condition>chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</condition> in patients with breast cancer after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. This is the first study in which the NK(1)-receptor antagonist, aprepitant (APR), was evaluated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Eligible <eligibility>breast cancer patients were naive to emetogenic chemotherapy and treated with cyclophosphamide +/- doxorubicin or epirubicin</eligibility>. Patients were randomly assigned to either an aprepitant regimen (day 1, APR 125 mg, ondansetron (OND) 8 mg, and dexamethasone 12 mg before chemotherapy and OND 8 mg 8 hours later; days 2 through 3, APR 80 qd) [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] or a <control>control regimen</control> (day 1, OND 8 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg before chemotherapy and OND 8 mg 8 hours later; days 2 through 3, OND 8 mg bid). Data on nausea, vomiting, and use of rescue medication were collected with a self-report diary. The primary efficacy end point was the <outcome-Measure>proportion of patients with complete response</outcome-Measure>, defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy, during 120 hours after initiation of chemotherapy in cycle 1. The secondary end point was the <outcome-Measure>proportion of patients with an average item score higher than 6 of 7 on the Functional Living Index-Emesis questionnaire</outcome-Measure>. Of <No-of-participants>866</No-of-participants> patients randomized, <No-of-participants>857</No-of-participants> patients (99%) were assessable. Overall <outcome>complete response</outcome> was greater with the aprepitant regimen than with the control regimen (<intervention-value>50.8%</intervention-value> v <control-value>42.5%</control-value>; P = .015). More patients in the aprepitant group reported minimal or no <outcome>impact of CINV on daily life</outcome> (<intervention-value>63.5%</intervention-value> v <control-value>55.6%</control-value>; P = .019). Both treatments were generally well tolerated. The aprepitant regimen was more effective than the control regimen for prevention of CINV in patients receiving both an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide.
