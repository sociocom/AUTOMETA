<intervention>Telephone counseling</intervention> and attendance in a national mammography-screening program a randomized controlled trial. In <location>Germany</location>, a mammography-screening program (MSP) was implemented on a national level. It complies with all criteria of the European guidelines for quality assurance in screening mammography; however, the attendance rate is 54%, falling short of the target attendance rate of 70%. The aim of this study was to investigate whether additional telephone counseling improves attendance among nonresponders and the level of satisfaction with telephone counseling. In a prospective RCT, women identified as nonresponders in the MSP were randomized to a <control>control group</control> that received <control>written reminders</control> or to an intervention group that additionally received telephone counseling. In a follow-up, a subset of the intervention group was contacted by telephone regarding their satisfaction with telephone counseling. In 2008, a total of <No-of-participants>5477</No-of-participants> women aged <average-age>50-69 years</average-age> who were eligible for the German MSP but had not participated up to 6 weeks after the first invitation were included in the study. Individual telephone counseling consisted of scripted calls from a trained counselor who provided information on MSP and answered the woman's questions. Report of mammography use provided by the screening unit 3 months after the reminder was sent. Analysis was conducted in 2009. Comparison of screening attendance revealed a significantly higher <outcome>attendance rate</outcome> in the intervention group compared with controls (<intervention-value>29.7%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>26.1%</control-value>, p=0.0035). When only women for whom telephone numbers were available were analyzed, <outcome>attendance</outcome> was even better (<intervention-value>35.5%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>29.7%</control-value>, p=0.0004). In the follow-up, <No-of-participants>278</No-of-participants> of 404 women were actually surveyed. Of those, 33% stated that telephone counseling had <outcome>influenced their decision</outcome>, 56% stated that they had <outcome>undergone screening mammography</outcome>, and 77% agreed that personal telephone counseling should be used routinely to encourage nonresponders to go for <outcome>screening</outcome>. Individual telephone counseling for nonresponders to a national program for breast cancer screening was well accepted by participants and effective.
