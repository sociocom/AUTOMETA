Quality of life among women diagnosed with breast Cancer: A randomized waitlist controlled trial of commercially available <intervention>mobile app-delivered mindfulness training</intervention>. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of commercially available mobile app-delivered mindfulness training (AMT), compared with <control>waitlist control (WC)</control>, on quality of life (QOL) among women diagnosed with breast cancer. The secondary outcome was dispositional mindfulness. Enrollment, app utilization, and study completion are reported as feasibility objectives. <eligibility>Women diagnosed with breast cancer ≤5 years</eligibility> (n = <No-of-participants>112</No-of-participants>) were randomized to AMT (n = <intervention-participants>57</intervention-participants>) or WC (n = <control-participants>55</control-participants>), over <duration>8 weeks</duration>, with 4 weeks of follow-up. We conducted linear mixed effects models to examine group by observation interactions on QOL and dispositional mindfulness at baseline, during intervention (5-weeks), post-intervention (9-weeks), and follow-up (12-weeks post-baseline). Participants assigned to AMT reported higher <outcome>QOL</outcome>, compared with those assigned to WC, from baseline through follow-up t(258.40) = 3.09, P &lt;0.01, 95% CI [2.71, 11.90]. Participants assigned to AMT also reported higher <outcome>dispositional mindfulness</outcome>, compared with those assigned to WC, from baseline through follow-up t(268.44) = 2.04, P = 0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.57]. App utilization data was obtained from 34 participants. Fewer participants assigned to AMT <outcome>completed all study assessments</outcome>, compared with participants assigned to WC, (χ21  = 7.07, P = 0.008). Findings suggest commercially available AMT may proffer some benefit to women seeking to enhance their QOL following breast cancer diagnosis.
