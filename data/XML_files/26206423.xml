The Minnesota Green Tea Trial (MGTT), a randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of green tea extract on biomarkers of breast cancer risk: study rationale, design, methods, and participant characteristics. The Minnesota Green Tea Trial (MGTT) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial investigating the effect of daily green tea extract consumption for 12 months on biomarkers of breast cancer risk. Participants were <eligibility>healthy postmenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer due to dense breast tissue with differing catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotypes</eligibility>. The intervention was a <intervention>green tea catechin extract</intervention> containing 843.0 Â± 44.0 mg/day epigallocatechin gallate or <control>placebo</control> capsules for 1 year. Annual digital screening mammograms were obtained at baseline and month 12, and fasting blood and 24-h urine samples were provided at baseline and at months 6 and 12. Primary endpoints included <outcome-Measure>changes in percent mammographic density</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>circulating endogenous sex hormones</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>insulin-like growth factor axis proteins</outcome-Measure>; secondary endpoints were <outcome-Measure>changes in urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>circulating F2-isoprostanes</outcome-Measure>, a biomarker of oxidative stress. The MGTT screened more than 100,000 mammograms and randomized <No-of-participants>1,075</No-of-participants> participants based on treatment (green tea extract vs. placebo), stratified by COMT genotype activity (high COMT vs. low/intermediate COMT genotype activity). A total of <No-of-participants>937</No-of-participants> women successfully completed the study and 138 dropped out (overall dropout rate = 12.8 %). In this paper we report the rationale, design, recruitment, participant characteristics, and methods for biomarker and statistical analyses.
