Assessment of a <intervention>guideline-based heart substructures delineation</intervention> in <eligibility>left-sided breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy</eligibility> : Quality assessment within a randomized phase III trial testing a cardioprotective treatment strategy (SAFE-2014). In our institute, breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant treatment are included in a protocol aimed to reduce <condition>cardiovascular morbidity</condition> (SAFE-2014, NCT2236806), assessing preclinical heart damage with heart speckle-tracking ultrasound. To develop a dose constraint related to subclinical heart damage, a reliable delineation of heart substructures based on a pre-existing guideline was made. Heart substructures of <No-of-participants>16</No-of-participants> left-sided breast cancer patients included in the SAFE protocol were delineated by five operators. For each substructure, a multi-contour delineation based on a majority vote algorithm (MCD) was created. A consensus-based delineation (CBD) was developed by an independent team of two blinded operators. <outcome-Measure>Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) between volumes delineated by different operators and the MCD</outcome-Measure> were collected and reported, as well as DSC between CBD and MCD. <outcome>Mean DSCs between heart chambers delineated by each operator and the corresponding MCDs</outcome> ranged between 0.78 and 0.96. <outcome>Mean DSC between substructures delineated by all single operators and the corresponding MCD</outcome> ranged between 0.84 and 0.94. <outcome>Mean DSC between CBD and the corresponding MCD</outcome> ranged from 0.89 to 0.97. Results showed low inter-observer variability of heart substructure delineation. This constitutes an external validation of the contouring atlas used, allowing a reliable dosimetric assessment of these volumes within the SAFE-2014 trial.
