Does the use of <intervention>fibrin glue</intervention> prevent <condition>seroma formation</condition> after axillary lymphadenectomy for breast cancer? A prospective randomized trial in <No-of-participants>159</No-of-participants> patients. Seroma formation frequently occurs in patients who have undergone axillary lymphadenectomy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of fibrin glue in the prevention of seroma formation after axillary lymphadenectomy. <No-of-participants>Hundred fifty-nine</No-of-participants> <eligibility>breast cancer patients about to undergo quadrantectomy or mastectomy plus axillary lymphadenectomy</eligibility> were enrolled in the study and randomized into two groups. Fibrin glue spray applied to the axillary fossa plus placement of closed suction drainage were used in <intervention-participants>80</intervention-participants> patients (group A); <control>placement of closed suction drainage</control> was only used in <control-participants>79</control-participants> patients (group B). Group A patients showed a slight advantage with regard to the <outcome>mean duration of axillary drainage placement</outcome> (4.5 +/- 1.3 days in group A vs. 5.1 +/- 1.6 days in group B) and <outcome>number of seroma aspirations</outcome> (6.3 +/- 1.1 in group A vs. 6.7 +/- 1.2 in group B). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups of patients regarding the <outcome>mean volume of total axillary drainage and of total seroma volume</outcome>. The use of fibrin glue does not prevent seroma formation and does not reduce seroma magnitude and duration. The costs of the product involved do not justify its routine use in patients undergoing axillary dissection.
