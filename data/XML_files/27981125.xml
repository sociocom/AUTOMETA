Effect of an <intervention>education</intervention> program on knowledge, self-care behavior and handwashing competence on prevention of <condition>febrile neutropenia</condition> among <eligibility>breast cancer patients receiving Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide</eligibility> in Chemotherapy Day Centre. To evaluate the efficacy of an education program on the prevention of febrile neutropenia (FN) among <eligibility>breast cancer patients receiving AC regimen</eligibility>. Randomized controlled trial with the repeated-measures design was conducted in a Chemotherapy Day Centre of an acute hospital in Hong Kong. <intervention-participants>Twenty-five</intervention-participants> subjects in the intervention group received an individual education session followed by three follow-up sessions and routine care. <control-participants>Twenty-four</control-participants> subjects in the <control>control</control> group received <control>routine care</control>. Primary outcomes included the <outcome-Measure>incidence of admission due to FN</outcome-Measure>, the <outcome-Measure>self-care behavior adherence</outcome-Measure>, the <outcome-Measure>knowledge level on prevention of FN</outcome-Measure> and the <outcome-Measure>self-efficacy in self-management</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>handwashing competence</outcome-Measure> were assessed by self-designed questionnaires, Chinese version of patient activation measure, and handwashing competence checklist. No statistically significant difference between the intervention group and the control group on the <outcome>incidence of admission due to FN, the self-efficacy in self-management, and the knowledge on prevention of FN</outcome>. The <outcome>self-care behavior adherence</outcome> was significant at cycle 4 of AC regimen in favor of the intervention group (P = 0.036). <outcome>Handwashing competence</outcome> improved more significantly among subjects in the intervention group than the control group (P = 0.009). The education program on the prevention of FN had significantly favorable effects on self-care behavior adherence and handwashing competence across time. However, the intervention did not lead to statistically significant improvement on the incidence of admission due to FN, the self-efficacy in self-management and the knowledge level on prevention of FN.
