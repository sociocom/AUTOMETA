Topical use of <intervention>recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF)-based cream</intervention> to prevent <intervention>radiation dermatitis</intervention> in breast cancer patients: a single-blind randomized preliminary study. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF)-based cream for the prevention of acute radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy (RT). <duration>Between December 2012 and April 2013</duration>, <No-of-participants>40</No-of-participants> <eligibility>breast cancer patients who received postoperative RT were prospectively</eligibility> enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to receive human recombinant EGF-based cream (intervention group) or <control>general supportive skin care (control group)</control>. The <outcome-Measure>grade of radiation dermatitis</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>pain score</outcome-Measure> were examined at weekly intervals during RT and 6 weeks after RT completion. All patients completed the planned RT and complied well with instructions for applying the study cream and general supportive skin care. In the intervention group, <outcome>radiation dermatitis of maximum grade 3, 2, and 1</outcome> developed in <intervention-value>3</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>15%</intervention-value>), <intervention-value>11</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>55%</intervention-value>), and <intervention-value>6</intervention-value> patients (<intervention-value>30%</intervention-value>), respectively. In comparison, in the control group, <outcome>radiation dermatitis of maximum grade 3, 2, and 1</outcome> developed in <control-value>8</control-value> (<control-value>40%</control-value>), <control-value>10</control-value> (<control-value>50%</control-value>), and <control-value>2</control-value> patients (<control-value>10%</control-value>), respectively. The intervention group showed lower <outcome>incidence of grade 3 radiation dermatitis</outcome> than the control group (p=0.068 in univariate analysis and p=0.035 in multivariate analysis). There was no statistically significant difference in the maximal <outcome>pain score</outcome> between the two groups (p=0.934). This single-blind randomized preliminary study showed that recombinant human EGF-based cream can have a beneficial role in preventing or minimizing radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients. To confirm the results of our study, additional studies with a large sample size are required.
