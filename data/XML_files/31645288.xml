Recurrence of breast cancer after <intervention>regional or general anaesthesia</intervention>: a randomised controlled trial. Three perioperative factors impair host defence against recurrence during cancer surgery: the surgical stress response, use of volatile anaesthetic, and opioids for analgesia. All factors are ameliorated by regional anaesthesia-analgesia. We tested the primary hypothesis that breast cancer recurrence after potentially curative surgery is lower with regional anaesthesia-analgesia using paravertebral blocks and the anaesthetic propofol than with general anaesthesia with the volatile anaesthetic sevoflurane and opioid analgesia. A second hypothesis was that regional anaesthesia-analgesia reduces persistent incisional pain. We did a randomised controlled trial at 13 hospitals in <location>Argentina, Austria, China, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, and the USA</location>. Women (age <average-age>&lt;5 years</average-age>) <eligibility>having potentially curative primary breast cancer resections</eligibility> were randomised by computer to either regional anaesthesia-analgesia (paravertebral blocks and propofol) or <control>general anaesthesia</control> (sevoflurane) and opioid analgesia. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>local or metastatic breast cancer recurrence</outcome-Measure>. The secondary outcome was <outcome-Measure>incisional pain at 6 months and 12 months</outcome-Measure>. Primary analyses were done under intention-to-treat principles. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00418457. The study was stopped after a preplanned futility boundary was crossed. <duration>Between Jan 30, 2007, and Jan 18, 2018</duration>, <No-of-participants>2132</No-of-participants> women were enrolled to the study, of whom 24 were excluded before surgery. <intervention-participants>1043</intervention-participants> were assigned to regional anaesthesia-analgesia and <control-participants>1065</control-participants> were allocated to general anaesthesia. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between study groups. Median follow-up was 36 (IQR 24-49) months. Among women assigned regional anaesthesia-analgesia, <intervention-value>102</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>10%</intervention-value>) <outcome>recurrences</outcome> were reported, compared with <control-value>111</control-value> (<control-value>10%</control-value>) recurrences among those allocated general anaesthesia (hazard ratio 0·97, 95% CI 0·74-1·28; p=0·84). <outcome>Incisional pain</outcome> was reported by <intervention-value>442</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>52%</intervention-value>) of <intervention-participants>856</intervention-participants> patients assigned to regional anaesthesia-analgesia and <control-value>456</control-value> (<control-value>52%</control-value>) of <control-participants>872</control-participants> patients allocated to general anaesthesia <outcome>at 6 months</outcome>, and by <intervention-value>239</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>28%</intervention-value>) of <intervention-participants>854</intervention-participants> patients and <control-value>232</control-value> (<control-value>27%</control-value>) of <control-participants>852</control-participants> patients, respectively, <outcome>at 12 months</outcome> (overall interim-adjusted odds ratio 1·00, 95% CI 0·85-1·17; p=0·99). <outcome>Neuropathic breast pain</outcome> did not differ by anaesthetic technique and was reported by <intervention-value>87</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>10%</intervention-value>) of <intervention-participants>859</intervention-participants> patients assigned to regional anaesthesia-analgesia and <control-value>89</control-value> (<control-value>10%</control-value>) of <control-participants>870</control-participants> patients allocated to general anaesthesia <outcome>at 6 months</outcome>, and by <intervention-value>57</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>7%</intervention-value>) of <intervention-participants>857</intervention-participants> patients and <control-value>57</control-value> (<control-value>7%</control-value>) of <control-participants>854</control-participants> patients, respectively, <outcome>at 12 months</outcome>. In our study population, regional anaesthesia-analgesia (paravertebral block and propofol) did not reduce breast cancer recurrence after potentially curative surgery compared with volatile anaesthesia (sevoflurane) and opioids. The frequency and severity of persistent incisional breast pain was unaffected by anaesthetic technique. Clinicians can use regional or general anaesthesia with respect to breast cancer recurrence and persistent incisional pain.
