<intervention>Novel hyaluronan formulation</intervention> for preventing <condition>acute skin reactions</condition> in breast during radiotherapy: a randomized clinical trial. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial to investigate the use of a new proprietary hyaluronan (HA) formulation for the prevention of acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). <No-of-participants>Thirty</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with breast cancer undergoing whole breast RT</eligibility> were enrolled. Each patient was randomly assigned to HA formulation (study cream, S) on the medial or lateral half of the irradiated breast and the <control>control cream (placebo, P)</control> on the other half. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>physician's evaluation of skin symptoms at week 5 during RT and week 2 post-RT</outcome-Measure>. We also collected <outcome-Measure>patients' independent assessment of skin after RT, patient's product preference, and an independent physician panel assessment of skin reactions based on photographs</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>Twenty-eight</No-of-participants> patients were evaluable. On physician's evaluation, there was <outcome>no significant difference in radiation dermatitis</outcome> between S and P and no overall preference to either cream at week 5 during or week 2 post-RT. More patients preferred S in evaluating <outcome>skin appearance and skin reactions</outcome>, but this did not reach statistical significance. Univariate analysis showed that physicians had an overall preference to the S cream at week 2 post-RT in patients with larger breasts. On the independent panel assessment, 3 reviewers saw no significant difference in radiation toxicity, whereas one reviewer reported better skin outcome with S cream at week 5. We found a nonstatistically significant patient preference but overall no significant radioprotective effects for this HA formulation compared with placebo except in patients with larger breasts. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02165605).
