Stress management, leukocyte transcriptional changes and breast cancer recurrence in a randomized trial: An exploratory analysis. <intervention>Cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM)</intervention> is an empirically-validated group-based psychosocial intervention. CBSM is related to decreased self-reported indicators of psychological adversity during breast cancer treatment and greater disease-free survival (DFS) vs. a control condition. This study examined relationships between CBSM, DFS, and a potential biobehavioral pathway linking these variables in breast cancer patients through a gene expression composite representing the leukocyte conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA). <eligibility>Women with stage 0-IIIb breast cancer</eligibility> completed questionnaires and provided blood samples post-surgery. Participants were randomized to <duration>10-week</duration> group-based CBSM or a <control>psychoeducation control group</control> and followed at 6 months, 12 months, and median 11 years. In total, <No-of-participants>51</No-of-participants> participants provided blood data for longitudinal analyses (CBSM n=<intervention-participants>28</intervention-participants>; Control n=<control-participants>23</control-participants>). Mixed model analyses examined CBSM effects on 6-12 month <outcome-Measure>changes in CTRA expression</outcome-Measure> (53 indicator genes representing pro-inflammatory, anti-viral and antibody production signaling). Cox regression models assessed the relationship between <outcome-Measure>6 and 12 month changes in CTRA expression</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>11-year DFS</outcome-Measure>. Patients randomized to CBSM showed attenuated <outcome>6-12 month change in CTRA gene expression</outcome>, whereas patients randomized to control showed increased CTRA expression (p=0.014). <outcome>Average DFS</outcome> was 5.92 years (SD=3.90). Greater 6-12 month CTRA increases predicted shorter 11-year DFS controlling for covariates (p=0.007). CBSM attenuated CTRA gene expression during the initial year of breast cancer treatment. In turn, greater increases in CTRA gene expression predicted shorter long-term DFS. These findings identify a biobehavioral oncology pathway to examine in future work.
