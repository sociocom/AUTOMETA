Primary <intervention>granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis</intervention> during the first two cycles only or throughout all chemotherapy cycles in patients with breast cancer at risk for <condition>febrile neutropenia</condition>. Early breast cancer is commonly treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. However, combining these drugs increases the risk of myelotoxicity and may require granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. The highest incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) and largest benefit of G-CSF during the first cycles of chemotherapy lead to questions about the effectiveness of continued use of G-CSF throughout later cycles of chemotherapy. In a multicenter study, <eligibility>patients with breast cancer who were considered fit enough to receive 3-weekly polychemotherapy, but also had > 20% risk for FN</eligibility>, were randomly assigned to primary G-CSF prophylaxis during the first two chemotherapy cycles only (experimental arm) or to <control>primary G-CSF prophylaxis throughout all chemotherapy cycles</control> (<control>standard arm</control>). The noninferiority hypothesis was that the incidence of FN would be maximally 7.5% higher in the experimental compared with the standard arm. After inclusion of <No-of-participants>167</No-of-participants> eligible patients, the independent data monitoring committee advised <outcome>premature study closure</outcome>. Of <control-participants>84</control-participants> patients randomly assigned to G-CSF throughout all chemotherapy cycles, <control-value>eight (10%)</control-value> experienced an <outcome>episode of FN</outcome>. In contrast, of <intervention-participants>83</intervention-participants> patients randomly assigned to G-CSF during the first two cycles only, <intervention-value>30 (36%)</intervention-value> had an <outcome>FN episode</outcome> (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.54), with a peak incidence of 24% in the third cycle (ie, first cycle without G-CSF prophylaxis). In patients with early breast cancer at high risk for FN, continued use of primary G-CSF prophylaxis during all chemotherapy cycles is of clinical relevance and thus cannot be abandoned.
