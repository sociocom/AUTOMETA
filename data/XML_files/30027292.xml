Association of <intervention>Transforming Growth Factor β Polymorphism C-509T</intervention> With <condition>Radiation-Induced Fibrosis</condition> Among <eligibility>Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer</eligibility>: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial. Whether genetic factors can identify patients at risk for radiation-induced fibrosis remains unconfirmed. To assess the association between the C-509T variant allele in the promoter region of TGFB1 and breast fibrosis 3 years after radiotherapy. This is an a priori-specified, prospective, cohort study nested in an open-label, randomized clinical trial, which was conducted in community-based and academic cancer centers to compare hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (WBI) (42.56 Gy in 16 fractions) with conventionally fractionated WBI (50 Gy in 25 fractions) after breast-conserving surgery. In total, <No-of-participants>287</No-of-participants> women <average-age>40 years or older</average-age> <eligibility>with pathologically confirmed stage 0 to IIA breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery</eligibility> were enrolled <duration>from February 2011 to February 2014</duration>. Patients were observed for a minimum of <duration>3 years</duration>. Outcomes were compared using the 1-sided Fisher exact test and multivariable logistic regression. A C-to-T single-nucleotide polymorphism at position -509 relative to the first major transcription start site (C-509T) of the TGFB1 gene. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>grade 2 or higher breast fibrosis</outcome-Measure> as assessed using the Late Effects Normal Tissue/Subjective, Objective, Medical Management, Analytic scale (range, 0 to 3) three years after radiotherapy. Among <No-of-participants>287</No-of-participants> women enrolled in the trial, TGFB1 genotype and 3-year radiotherapy-induced toxicity data were available for <No-of-participants>174</No-of-participants> patients, of whom 89 patients (51%) with a mean (SD) age of 60 (8) years had at least 1 copy of C-509T. <outcome>Grade 2 or higher breast fibrosis</outcome> was present in <intervention-value>12</intervention-value> of <intervention-participants>87</intervention-participants> patients with C-509T (<intervention-value>13.8%</intervention-value>) compared with <control-value>3</control-value> of <control-participants>80</control-participants> patients without the allele variant (<control-value>3.8%</control-value>) (absolute difference, 10.0%; 95% CI, 1.7%-18.4%; P = .02). The results of multivariable analyses indicated that only C-509T (odds ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 1.25-15.99; P = .02) and postoperative cosmetic outcome (odds ratio, 7.09; 95% CI, 2.41-20.90; P &lt;.001) were significantly associated with breast fibrosis risk. To date, this study seems to be the first prospective validation of a genomic marker for radiation fibrosis. The C-509T allele in TGFB1 is a key determinant of breast fibrosis risk. Assessing TGFB1 genotype may facilitate a more personalized approach to locoregional treatment decisions in breast cancer. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01266642.
