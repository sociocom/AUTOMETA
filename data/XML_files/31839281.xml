Use of <intervention>anastrozole</intervention> for breast cancer prevention (IBIS-II): long-term results of a randomised controlled trial. Two large clinical trials have shown a reduced rate of breast cancer development in high-risk women in the initial 5 years of follow-up after use of aromatase inhibitors (MAP.3 and International Breast Cancer Intervention Study II [IBIS-II]). Here, we report blinded long-term follow-up results for the IBIS-II trial, which compared anastrozole with <control>placebo</control>, with the objective of determining the efficacy of anastrozole for preventing breast cancer (both invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ) in the post-treatment period. IBIS-II is an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. <eligibility>Postmenopausal women at increased risk of developing breast cancer</eligibility> were recruited and were randomly assigned (1:1) to either anastrozole (1 mg per day, oral) or matching placebo daily for <duration>5 years</duration>. After treatment completion, women were followed on a yearly basis to collect data on breast cancer incidence, death, other cancers, and major adverse events (cardiovascular events and fractures). The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>all breast cancer</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>3864</No-of-participants> women were recruited <duration>between Feb 2, 2003, and Jan 31, 2012</duration>. <intervention-participants>1920</intervention-participants> women were randomly assigned to 5 years anastrozole and <control-participants>1944</control-participants> to placebo. After a median follow-up of 131 months (IQR 105-156), a <intervention-value>49%</intervention-value> <outcome>reduction in breast cancer</outcome> was observed for anastrozole (<intervention-value>85</intervention-value> vs <control-value>165</control-value> cases, hazard ratio [HR] 0·51, 95% CI 0·39-0·66, p&lt;·0001). The <outcome>reduction</outcome> was larger in the <outcome>first 5 years</outcome> (<intervention-value>35</intervention-value> vs <control-value>89</control-value>, 0·39, 0·27-0·58, p&lt;·0001), but still significant <outcome>after 5 years</outcome> (<intervention-value>50</intervention-value> vs <control-value>76</control-value> new cases, 0·64, 0·45-0·91, p=0·014), and not significantly different from the first 5 years (p=0·087). <outcome>Invasive oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer</outcome> was reduced by <intervention-value>54%</intervention-value> (HR 0·46, 95% CI 0·33-0·65, p&lt;·0001), with a continued significant effect in the period after treatment. A <intervention-value>59%</intervention-value> <outcome>reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ</outcome> was observed (0·41, 0·22-0·79, p=0·0081), especially in participants known to be oestrogen receptor-positive (0·22, 0·78-0·65, p&lt;·0001). No significant difference in <outcome>deaths</outcome> was observed overall (<intervention-value>69</intervention-value> vs <control-value>70</control-value>, HR 0·96, 95% CI 0·69-1·34, p=0·82) or <outcome>for breast cancer</outcome> (<intervention-value>two</intervention-value> anastrozole vs <control-value>three</control-value> placebo). A significant <outcome>decrease in non-breast cancers</outcome> was observed for anastrozole (<intervention-value>147</intervention-value> vs <control-value>200</control-value>, odds ratio 0·72, 95% CI 0·57-0·91, p=0·0042), owing primarily to non-melanoma skin cancer. <outcome>No excess of fractures or cardiovascular disease</outcome> was observed. This analysis has identified a significant continuing reduction in breast cancer with anastrozole in the post-treatment follow-up period, with no evidence of new late side-effects. Further follow-up is needed to assess the effect on breast cancer mortality.
