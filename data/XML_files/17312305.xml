Twenty-year follow-up of the Royal Marsden randomized, double-blinded <intervention>tamoxifen</intervention> breast cancer prevention trial. Several clinical trials have reported an early reduction in breast cancer incidence in healthy women using tamoxifen to reduce their risk of breast cancer but have not reported longer follow-up data for the evaluation of breast cancer prevention. We report the blinded <duration>20-year</duration> follow-up (median follow-up = 13 years) of the Royal Marsden trial to identify any long-term prevention of breast cancer associated with tamoxifen treatment. We randomly assigned <No-of-participants>2494</No-of-participants> <eligibility>healthy women</eligibility> to oral tamoxifen (20 mg/day) or <control>placebo</control> for 8 years. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>occurrence of invasive breast cancer</outcome-Measure>. A secondary planned analysis of <outcome-Measure>estrogen receptor (ER)-positive invasive breast cancer</outcome-Measure> was also done. Survival was assessed by use of a Cox proportional hazards model in both univariate and multivariable analyses. The durability of the treatment effect was assessed by use of a Cox regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Among the <No-of-participants>2471</No-of-participants> eligible participants (<intervention-participants>1238</intervention-participants> participants in the tamoxifen arm and <control-participants>1233</control-participants> participants in the placebo arm), 186 developed <outcome>invasive breast cancer</outcome> (<intervention-value>82</intervention-value> on tamoxifen and <control-value>104</control-value> on placebo; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58 to 1.04; P = .1). Of these 186 cancers, 139 were <outcome>ER positive</outcome> (<intervention-value>53</intervention-value> on tamoxifen and <control-value>86</control-value> on placebo; HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.86; P = .005). The <outcome>risk of ER-positive breast cancer</outcome> was not statistically significantly lower in the tamoxifen arm than in the placebo arm during the 8-year treatment period (<intervention-value>30</intervention-value> cancers in the tamoxifen arm and <control-value>39</control-value> in the placebo arm; HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.48 to 1.23; P = .3) but was statistically significantly lower in the <outcome>posttreatment period</outcome> (<intervention-value>23</intervention-value> in the tamoxifen arm and <control-value>47</control-value> in the placebo arm; HR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.79; P = .004). <intervention-value>Fifty-four</intervention-value> participants in each arm have <outcome>died</outcome> from any cause (HR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.44; P = .95). The adverse event profiles for both arms were similar to those previously reported and occurred predominantly during the treatment period. A statistically significant reduction in the incidence of ER-positive breast cancer was observed in the tamoxifen arm that occurred predominantly during the post treatment follow-up, indicating long-term prevention of estrogen-dependent breast cancer by tamoxifen.
