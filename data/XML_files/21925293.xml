<intervention>Electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system</intervention> in axillary dissection: a prospective randomized clinical study. We assessed whether axillary dissection using the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system (LigaSure) improved perioperative outcome when compared with conventional axillary dissection, in a prospective randomized study of <No-of-participants>100</No-of-participants> women with breast cancer. <eligibility>Those needing axillary dissection</eligibility> were randomized to the use of <intervention>LigaSure</intervention> or to <control>conventional axillary dissection</control> (with <intervention-participants>50</intervention-participant<control-participants>s></control-participants> patients in each group, all of whom had a closed suction drain in the axilla). The LigaSure patients had <outcome>less intraoperative blood loss</outcome> (exceeding 199 mL in <intervention-value>30.8%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>69.2%</control-value>, P &lt;0.001), <outcome>quicker axillary dissection</outcome> (mean 48 vs. 63.2 min, P = 0.004), <outcome>fewer days of suction drainage</outcome> (4.3 vs. 5.7 days, P = 0.012), and <outcome>shorter hospitalization</outcome> (5.1 vs. 6.5 days, P = 0.021). No difference was found in the <outcome>rate of hematomas, reoperations or infection</outcome>. The use of LigaSure in axillary surgery reduced the <outcome>surgical time and length of hospital stay</outcome>, favoring early drain removal without increasing postoperative complications.
