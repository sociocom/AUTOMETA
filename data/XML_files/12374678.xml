A phase II breast cancer chemoprevention trial of oral <intervention>alpha-difluoromethylornithine</intervention>: breast tissue, imaging, and serum and urine biomarkers. A double-blind randomized Phase II chemoprevention trial of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) was conducted in a group of <eligibility>women at high risk for development of breast cancer</eligibility>. DFMO is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the limiting enzyme of polyamine synthesis that is often up-regulated in breast cancer. Study entrants were required to have random periareolar fine-needle aspiration cytology prior to entry that exhibited hyperplasia or hyperplasia with atypia, as well as a mammogram and clinical breast exam judged as not suspicious for breast cancer and no clinical hearing loss. Subjects were randomized to <duration>6 months</duration> of oral DFMO (0.5 g/m(2)/day) or <control>placebo</control>, followed by repeat fine-needle aspiration and biomarker assessment. The main study end point was an <outcome-Measure>improvement in cytologic pattern</outcome-Measure>. Of <No-of-participants>119</No-of-participants> subjects entered, 96% completed the study and were evaluable for the main study end point. A <outcome>modest reduction</outcome> (<intervention-value>28%</intervention-value>) in average <outcome>total urine polyamines</outcome> was obtained in the DFMO group, but there was <intervention-value>no</intervention-value> <outcome>reduction in the spermidine:spermine ratio</outcome>. There was <outcome>no difference in cytologic improvement</outcome> between DFMO and placebo. Likewise, there was <outcome>no difference between DFMO and placebo for the secondary end points of breast molecular marker changes</outcome> (immunocytochemical expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, p53, and epidermal growth factor receptor), mammographic breast density, serum insulin-like growth factor I: insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 ratio, adverse events, quality of life indices, or subsequent cancer development. DFMO at a dose level of 0.5 g/m(2)/day administered for 6 months does not modulate breast risk biomarkers tested in this study.
