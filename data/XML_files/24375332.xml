Patient-reported outcomes in women with breast cancer enrolled in a dual-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of acupuncture in reducing aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been associated with decrements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The objective of this study was to assess whether <intervention>real acupuncture (RA)</intervention>, compared with <control>sham acupuncture (SA)</control>, improves PROs in patients with breast cancer who are receiving an adjuvant AI. <eligibility>Postmenopausal women with a stage 0 through III breast cancer who received an AI and had treatment-associated musculoskeletal symptoms</eligibility> were randomized to receive <duration>8 weekly</duration> RA versus SA in a dual-center, randomized controlled trial. The <outcome-Measure>National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) menopausal symptoms questionnaire</outcome-Measure>, the <outcome-Measure>Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) scale</outcome-Measure>, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the <outcome-Measure>hot flash daily diary</outcome-Measure>, the <outcome-Measure>Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDI)</outcome-Measure>, and the <outcome-Measure>European quality-of-life survey (EuroQol)</outcome-Measure> were used to assess PROs at baseline and at 4weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. The intention-to-treat analysis included <intervention-participants>23</intervention-participants> patients in the RA arm and <control-participants>24</control-participants> patients in the SA arm. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. Compared with baseline, <outcome>scores</outcome> in the RA arm improved significantly at week 8 on the <outcome>CESD</outcome> (P = .022), <outcome>hot flash severity</outcome> (P = .006), <outcome>hot flash frequency</outcome> (P = .011), the <outcome>HFRDI</outcome> (P = .014), and <outcome>NSABP menopausal symptoms</outcome> (P = .022); scores in the SA arm improved significantly on the <outcome>EuroQol</outcome> (P = .022),the <outcome>HFRDI</outcome> (P = .043), and <outcome>NSABP menopausal symptoms</outcome> (P = .005). Post-hoc analysis indicated that <ethinicity>African American</ethinicity> patients (n = 9) benefited more from RA than SA compared with <ethinicity>non-African American</ethinicity> patients (n = 38) in reducing hot flash severity (P &lt;.001) and frequency (P &lt;.001) scores. Both RA and SA were associated with improvement in PROs among patients with breast cancer who were receiving AIs, and no significant difference was detected between arms. Racial differences in response to acupuncture warrant further study.
