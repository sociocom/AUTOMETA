Evaluation of Short-Term Use of <intervention>N-Acetylcysteine</intervention> as a Strategy for Prevention of <condition>Anthracycline-Induced Cardiomyopathy</condition>: EPOCH Trial - A Prospective Randomized Study. We investigate to determine whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can prevent anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. A total of <No-of-participants>103</No-of-participants> patients were enrolled in this prospective randomized open label controlled trial. They are <eligibility>patients first diagnosed with breast cancer or lymphoma, who require chemotherapy, including anthracycline like adriamycine or epirubicine</eligibility>. Patients were randomized to the NAC group {n=<intervention-participants>50</intervention-participants>; 1200 mg orally every 8 hours starting before and ending after the intravenous infusion of anthracycline in all chemotherapy cycles (3-6)} or the <control>control group</control> (n=<control-participants>53</control-participants>). Primary outcome was the <outcome-Measure>decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)</outcome-Measure> absolutely ≥10% from the baseline and concomitantly &lt;0% at 6-month. Composite of all-cause death, heart failure and readmission were compared. The <outcome>primary outcome</outcome> was not significantly different in the NAC and control groups {<intervention-value>3</intervention-value>/<intervention-participants>47</intervention-participants> (<intervention-value>6.4%</intervention-value>) vs. <control-value>1</control-value>/<control-participants>52</control-participants> (<control-value>1.9%</control-value>), p=0.343}. The <outcome>mean LVEF</outcome> significantly decreased in both the NAC (from 64.5 to 60.8%, p=0.001) and control groups (from 64.1 to 61.3%, p&lt;.001) after the completion of whole chemotherapy. The <outcome>mean LVEF change</outcome> did not differ between the two groups (-3.64% in NAC vs. -2.78% in control group, p=0.502). <outcome>Left ventricular (LV) end systolic dimension</outcome> increased with higher trend in NAC by 3.08±4.56 mm as compared with 1.47±1.83 mm in the control group (p=0.064). <outcome>LV end diastolic dimension</outcome> did not change in each group and change does not differ in both. <outcome>Peak E, A and E/A ratio change and cardiac enzymes</outcome> were comparable in two groups. <outcome>Cumulative 12-month event rate</outcome> was <intervention-value>6%</intervention-value> and <control-value>3.8%</control-value> in the NAC group and the control group, respectively, with no difference (p=0.672). We cannot prove that NAC prevents anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.
