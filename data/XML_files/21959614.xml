A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of <intervention>preemptive analgesia with bupivacaine</intervention> in patients undergoing mastectomy for carcinoma of the breast. In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial we tested the hypothesis that preemptive analgesia with bupivacaine applied in the area of the surgical incision in patients undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer would reduce <condition>post-operative acute pain</condition> and would reduce the amount of analgesics used during surgery and in the post-operative period. Participants were assigned into 1 of 2 groups--with bupivacaine applied in the area of surgical incision or with <control>placebo</control>. We assessed the <outcome-Measure>intraoperative consumption of fentanyl</outcome-Measure>, the <outcome-Measure>postoperative consumption of morphine delivered using a PCA method</outcome-Measure>, and the <outcome-Measure>subjective pain intensity</outcome-Measure> according to VAS score reported by patients in the early post-operative period. Out of 121 consecutive cases qualified for mastectomy, <No-of-participants>112</No-of-participants> women were allocated randomly to 1 of 2 groups--group A (bupivacaine) and group B (placebo). The final study group comprised 106 breast cancer cases. Between the groups, a statistically significant difference was observed with respect to: <outcome>lower fentanyl consumption during surgery</outcome> (p = 0.011), <outcome>lower morphine (delivered by means of a PCA) consumption</outcome> between the 4-12th postoperative hours (p = 0.02) and significantly <outcome>lower pain intensity</outcome> assessed according to VAS score at the 4th and 12th hours after surgery (p = 0.004 and p = 0.02 respectively) for the group A patients. Preemptive analgesia application in the form of infiltration of the area of planned surgical incisions with bupivacaine in breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy decreases post-operative pain sensation, limits the amount of fentanyl used during surgery, and reduces the demand for opiates in the hours soon after surgery.
