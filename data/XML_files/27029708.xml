Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the <intervention>HER2 peptide AE37 vaccine</intervention> in breast cancer patients to prevent <condition>recurrence</condition>. AE37 is the Ii-Key hybrid of the MHC class II peptide, AE36 (HER2 aa:776-790). Phase I studies showed AE37 administered with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to be safe and highly immunogenic. A prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial was conducted to evaluate the vaccine's efficacy. <eligibility>Clinically disease-free node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing any degree of HER2 [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1-3+]</eligibility> were enrolled. Patients were randomized to AE37 + GM-CSF versus <control>GM-CSF alone</control>. Toxicity was monitored. <outcome-Measure>Clinical recurrences</outcome-Measure> were documented and <outcome-Measure>disease-free survival (DFS)</outcome-Measure> analyzed. The trial enrolled <No-of-participants>298</No-of-participants> patients; <intervention-participants>153</intervention-participants> received AE37 + GM-CSF and <control-participants>145</control-participants> received GM-CSF alone. The groups were well matched for clinicopathologic characteristics. Toxicities have been minimal. At the time of the primary analysis, the <outcome>recurrence rate</outcome> in the vaccinated group was <intervention-value>12.4%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>13.8%</control-value> in the control group [relative risk reduction 12%, HR 0.885, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.472-1.659, P = 0.70]. The Kaplan-Meier estimated <outcome>5-year DFS rate</outcome> was <intervention-value>80.8%</intervention-value> in vaccinated versus <control-value>79.5%</control-value> in control patients. In planned subset analyses of <outcome>patients with IHC 1+/2+ HER2-expressing tumors</outcome>, <outcome>5-year DFS</outcome> was <intervention-value>77.2%</intervention-value> in vaccinated patients (n = <intervention-value>76</intervention-value>) versus <control-value>65.7%</control-value> in control patients (n = <control-value>78</control-value>) (P = 0.21). In <outcome>patients with triple-negative breast cancer</outcome> (HER2 IHC 1+/2+ and hormone receptor negative) <outcome>DFS</outcome> was <intervention-value>77.7%</intervention-value> in vaccinated patients (n = <intervention-value>25</intervention-value>) versus <control-value>49.0%</control-value> in control patients (n = <control-value>25</control-value>) (P = 0.12). The overall intention-to-treat analysis demonstrates no benefit to vaccination. However, the results confirm that the vaccine is safe and suggest that vaccination may have clinical benefit in patients with low HER2-expressing tumors, specifically TNBC. Further evaluation in a randomized trial enrolling TNBC patients is warranted.
