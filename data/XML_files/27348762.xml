Angiotensin II-Receptor Inhibition With <intervention>Candesartan</intervention> to Prevent <condition>Trastuzumab-Related Cardiotoxic Effects</condition> in <eligibility>Patients With Early Breast Cancer</eligibility>: A Randomized Clinical Trial. This is the first randomized placebo-controlled evaluation of a medical intervention for the prevention of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxic effects. To determine as the primary end point whether angiotensin II antagonist treatment with candesartan can prevent or ameliorate trastuzumab-related cardiotoxic effects, defined as a <outcome-Measure>decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of more than 15% or a decrease below the absolute value 45%</outcome-Measure>. This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted <duration>between October 2007 and October 2011</duration> in 19 hospitals in the <location>Netherlands</location>, enrolling <No-of-participants>210</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with early breast cancer testing positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) who were being considered for adjuvant systemic treatment with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab</eligibility>. A total of <duration>78 weeks</duration> of candesartan (32 mg/d) or <control>placebo</control> treatment; study treatment started at the same day as the first trastuzumab administration and continued until 26 weeks after completion of trastuzumab treatment. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>LVEF</outcome-Measure>. Secondary end points included <outcome-Measure>whether the N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) can be used as surrogate markers</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>whether genetic variability in germline ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) correlates with trastuzumab-related cardiotoxic effects</outcome-Measure>. A total of <No-of-participants>206</No-of-participants> participants were evaluable (mean age, <average-age>49 years</average-age>; age range, <average-age>25-69 years</average-age>) <intervention-participants>103</intervention-participants> in the candesartan group (mean age, <average-age>50 years</average-age>; age range, <average-age>25-69 years</average-age>) and <control-participants>103</control-participants> in the placebo group (mean age, <average-age>50 years</average-age>; age range, <average-age>30-67 years</average-age>). Of these, 36 manifested at least 1 of the 2 primary cardiac end points. There were 3.8% more <outcome>cardiac events</outcome> in the candesartan group than in the placebo group (95% CI, -7% to 15%; P = .58): <intervention-value>20</intervention-value> events (<intervention-value>19%</intervention-value>) and <control-value>16</control-value> events (<control-value>16%</control-value>), respectively. The <outcome>2-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events</outcome> was <intervention-value>0.28</intervention-value> (95% CI, 0.13-0.40) in the candesartan group and <control-value>0.16</control-value> (95% CI, 0.08-0.22) in the placebo group (P = .56). Candesartan did not affect <outcome>changes in NT-proBNP and hs-TnT values</outcome>, and these biomarkers were not associated with significant changes in LVEF. The Ala1170Pro homozygous ERBB2 genotype was associated with a lower likelihood of the occurrence of a cardiac event compared with Pro/Pro + Ala/Pro genotypes in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02-0.45; P = .003). The findings do not support the hypothesis that concomitant use of candesartan protects against a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction during or shortly after trastuzumab treatment in early breast cancer. The ERBB2 germline Ala1170Pro single nucleotide polymorphism may be used to identify patients who are at increased risk of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxic effects. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00459771.
