<intervention>Dexrazoxane</intervention> protects breast cancer patients with diabetes from <condition>chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity</condition>. To evaluate the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (DEX) on chemotherapy in patients with <eligibility>breast cancer with concurrent type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2)</eligibility>. <No-of-participants>Eighty</No-of-participants> female patients with breast cancer with DM2 were randomly assigned to receive <control>chemotherapy only</control> or chemotherapy plus DEX. All patients received 80 mg/m epirubicin and 500 mg/m cyclophosphamide by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for a total of 6 cycles. The group assigned to receive chemotherapy alone received placebo 30 minutes before epirubicin administration. The group assigned to receive chemotherapy plus DEX received 800 mg/m DEX 30 minutes before epirubicin administration. <outcome-Measure>Cardiac function</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>hematology</outcome-Measure> before and after 6 cycles of chemotherapy were analyzed. There was no difference in <outcome>baseline systole or diastole function</outcome> between the 2 DM2 groups. Patients receiving chemotherapy alone experienced significantly <outcome>greater reductions in Ea</outcome> and significantly <outcome>greater elevations in E/Ea and Tei index</outcome> in comparison with patients receiving chemotherapy plus DEX. After chemotherapy, <outcome>superoxide dismutase</outcome> was significantly reduced, and <outcome>serum malondialdehyde (MDA)</outcome> was significantly increased in patients with DM2. <outcome>Serum superoxide dismutase levels</outcome> were comparable between the 2 groups <outcome>before and after chemotherapy</outcome>, MDA levels were comparable between the 2 groups <outcome>before chemotherapy</outcome>, whereas <outcome>serum MDA</outcome> was significantly higher <outcome>after chemotherapy</outcome> in the chemotherapy alone group in comparison with the group that received DEX. DEX protects against cardiotoxicity induced by chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer with concurrent DM2.
