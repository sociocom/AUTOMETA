Randomized Double-blind Placebo-controlled Trial of <intervention>Celecoxib</intervention> for the Prevention of <condition>Skin Toxicity</condition> in <eligibility>Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer</eligibility>. The skin toxicity-induced by ionizing radiation may limit the duration of treatment and may lead to discomfort in quality of life of patients during radiotherapy. The purpose of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was to investigate the preventive effect of oral administration of celecoxib (CLX) on the acute radiation- induced skin toxicity in patients with breast cancer. <No-of-participants>Sixty</No-of-participants> breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to use CLX (400 mg per day) or <control>placebo</control> capsules during radiotherapy. <outcome-Measure>Radiation-induced dermatitis</outcome-Measure> was classified according to the radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) criteria, as well as <outcome-Measure>pain and itching</outcome-Measure> were scored according to the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) for six weeks of treatment. <outcome-Measure>Breast swelling</outcome-Measure> was evaluated through increase in the size of the breast during radiotherapy. Oral administration of CLX capsule during and after radiotherapy <outcome>reduced significantly radiation-induced itching and pain</outcome> in patients with breast cancer. CLX <outcome>reduced the frequency of increased breast size</outcome> caused by radiotherapy in patients as compared with placebo; however, this difference was statistically not significant. Patients who received CLX had <outcome>insignificantly skin dermatitis</outcome> when compared with placebo group. However, CLX was unable to reduce the dermatitis caused by ionizing radiation; it significantly reduced itching and pain in patients during radiotherapy. CLX may have beneficial effects in the quality life of breast cancer patients for treatment.
