<intervention>Hypofractionated radiation</intervention> treatment following mastectomy in early breast cancer: the Christchurch experience. Although hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) has become an accepted option for whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery, there is limited evidence to support HFRT to the chest wall following mastectomy. We retrospectively analysed post-mastectomy patients treated with HFRT in Christchurch to determine whether HFRT yields acceptable efficacy and toxicity. The Christchurch oncology database was used to identify breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant HFRT to the chest wall following a mastectomy <duration>between 2003 and 2008</duration>. Eligible post-mastectomy patients were treated with 40â€‰Gy in 16 daily fractions. Treatment outcomes assessed included <outcome-Measure>local recurrence-free survival</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>breast cancer survival</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>overall survival</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>acute toxicities</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>One hundred thirty-three</No-of-participants> patients were identified. The median follow-up period was <duration>5.03 years</duration>. <intervention-value>Three</intervention-value> patients had a <outcome>local recurrence</outcome> as a first event, resulting in <outcome>5-year local recurrence-free survival</outcome> of <intervention-value>97.6%</intervention-value>. <outcome>Five-year overall survival</outcome> and <outcome>5-year breast cancer survival</outcome> were <intervention-value>74.7%</intervention-value> and <intervention-value>77.7%</intervention-value>, respectively. The prospectively assessed acute toxicities were mostly grade 1. In particular, the incidence of <outcome>grade 2 skin toxicity</outcome> was <intervention-value>10.7%</intervention-value>, and <intervention-value>no</intervention-value> patients experienced <outcome>grade 3 skin toxicity</outcome>. The high local control rate with HFRT, combined with acceptable toxicity and the practical benefits of a shorter treatment time, supports its ongoing use in the eligible patient group. A randomised controlled trial would be necessary to more completely assess the acute and long-term toxicity of HFRT compared with standard fractionation.
