Increasing Adherence to Adjuvant Hormone Therapy Among Patients With Breast Cancer: A Smart Phone App-Based Pilot Study. This study tested the feasibility and efficacy of using a <intervention>text-based</intervention> intervention to increase initiation, decrease discontinuation, and improve adherence as prescribed to adjuvant hormone therapy (AHT) among hyphenate post-menopausal breast cancer survivors. The <duration>3-month</duration> intervention consisted of daily text message reminders to take medication, coupled with a dynamic (eg, feedback on progress) tailored intervention using weekly interactive surveys delivered by a smartphone app. Five clinic sites within the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology participated. Hormone levels were measured prior to AHT initiation and at study exit. Of the <No-of-participants>39</No-of-participants> patients recruited to the pilot study, <No-of-participants>27</No-of-participants> (69.2%) completed all study requirements (completed both the baseline and the exit surveys, both blood draws, and did not miss more than 2 weekly surveys). Significant improvements were observed pre- to postintervention for self-reported <outcome>medication adherence</outcome> (P = .015), <outcome>mental health functioning</outcome> (P = .007), and <outcome>perceived stress</outcome> (P = .04). Significant decreases in <outcome>estradiol, estrogen, and estrone hormone levels</outcome> were observed from baseline to study exit (P &lt;.001), indicating the accuracy of self-reported AHT adherence. Participants (91.9%) and physicians (100%) agreed that participant participation in the intervention was beneficial. The results of this pilot study established the general feasibility and efficacy of an app-based intervention to support patient AHT adherence. Larger controlled, randomized trials are needed to examine the effectiveness of the app-based intervention in improving AHT and quality of life among breast cancer survivors.
