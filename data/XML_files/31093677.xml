The Effects of <intervention>Ganglioside-Monosialic Acid</intervention> in <condition>Taxane-Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity</condition> in Patients with Breast Cancer: A Randomized Trial. Taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) is a dose-limiting adverse effect. Ganglioside-monosialic acid (GM1) functions as a neuroprotective factor. We assessed the effects of GM1 on the prevention of TIPN in breast cancer patients. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including <No-of-participants>206</No-of-participants> <eligibility>patients with early-stage breast cancer planning to receive taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy with a follow-up of more than 1 year</eligibility>. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive GM1 (80 mg, day -1 to day 2) or <control>placebo</control>. The primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment Neurotoxicity subscale score after four cycles of chemotherapy</outcome-Measure>. Secondary endpoints included <outcome-Measure>neurotoxicity evaluated by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group neuropathy scale</outcome-Measure>. All statistical tests were two-sided. In <No-of-participants>183</No-of-participants> evaluable patients, the GM1 group reported better <outcome>mean Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment Neurotoxicity subscale scores</outcome> than patients in the placebo group after four cycles of chemotherapy (43.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 43.05 to 43.49 vs 34.34, 95% CI = 33.78 to 34.89; mean difference = 8.96, 95% CI = 8.38 to 9.54, P &lt;.001). <outcome>Grade 1 or higher peripheral neurotoxicity in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 scale</outcome> was statistically significantly lower in the GM1 group (<intervention-value>14.3%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>100.0%</control-value>, P &lt;.001). Additionally, the GM1 group had a statistically significantly lower <outcome>incidence of grade 1 or higher neurotoxicity assessed by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group neuropathy scale sensory neuropathy</outcome> (26.4% vs 97.8%, P &lt;.001) and motor neuropathy subscales (<intervention-value>20.9%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>81.5%</control-value>, P &lt;.001). The treatment with GM1 resulted in a reduction in the severity and incidence of TIPN after four cycles of taxane-containing chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.
