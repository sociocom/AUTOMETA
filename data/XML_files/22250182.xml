Race and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer outcomes in a randomized chemotherapy trial. The association between black race and worse outcomes in operable breast cancer reported in previous studies has been attributed to a higher incidence of more aggressive triple-negative disease, disparities in care, and comorbidities. We evaluated associations between <ethinicity>black race</ethinicity> and outcomes, by tumor hormone receptor and HER2 expression, in patients who were treated with contemporary adjuvant therapy. The effect of black race on <outcome-Measure>disease-free and overall survival</outcome-Measure> was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for multiple covariates in a clinical trial population that was treated with anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapy. Categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test. All P values are two-sided. Of <No-of-participants>4817</No-of-participants> eligible patients, <intervention-participants>405</intervention-participants> (8.4%) were <ethinicity>black</ethinicity>. Compared with <ethinicity>nonblack</ethinicity> patients, black patients had a higher <outcome>rate of triple-negative disease</outcome> (<intervention-value>31.9%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>17.2%</control-value>; P &lt;.001) and a higher body mass index (median: 31.7 vs 27.4 kg/m(2); P &lt;.001). Black race was statistically significantly associated with worse <outcome>disease-free survival</outcome> (5-year disease-free survival, black vs nonblack: <intervention-value>76.7%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>84.5%</control-value>; hazard ratio of recurrence or death = 1.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.19 to 2.10, P = .0015) and <outcome>overall survival</outcome> (5-year overall survival, black vs nonblack: <intervention-value>87.6%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>91.9%</control-value>; hazard ratio of death = 1.49, 95% confidence interval = 1.05 to 2.12, P = .025) in patients with hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative disease but not in patients with triple-negative or HER2-positive disease. In a model that included black race, hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative disease vs other subtypes, and their interaction, the interaction term was statistically significant for disease-free survival (P = .027) but not for overall survival (P = .086). Factors other than disparities in care or aggressive disease contribute to increased recurrence in black women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
