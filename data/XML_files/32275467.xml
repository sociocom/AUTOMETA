Adjuvant <intervention>Capecitabine</intervention> With Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide Plus Epirubicin for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (CBCSG010): An Open-Label, Randomized, Multicenter, Phase III Trial. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) includes a taxane and an anthracycline. Concomitant capecitabine may be beneficial, but robust data to support this are lacking. The efficacy and safety of the addition of capecitabine into the TNBC adjuvant treatment regimen was evaluated. This randomized, open-label, phase III trial was conducted in <location>China</location>. Eligible <eligibility>female patients with early TNBC after definitive surgery</eligibility> were randomly assigned (1:1) to either capecitabine (3 cycles of capecitabine and docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of capecitabine, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) or <control>control treatment</control> (3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Randomization was centralized without stratification. The primary end point was <outcome-Measure>disease-free survival (DFS)</outcome-Measure>. <duration>Between June 2012 and December 2013</duration>, <No-of-participants>636</No-of-participants> patients with TNBC were screened, and <No-of-participants>585</No-of-participants> were randomly assigned to treatment (control, <control-participants>288</control-participants>; capecitabine, <intervention-participants>297</intervention-participants>). Median follow-up was <duration>67 months</duration>. The <outcome>5-year DFS rate</outcome> was higher for capecitabine than for control treatment (<intervention-value>86.3%</intervention-value> v <control-value>80.4%;</control-value> hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.99; P = .044). <outcome>Five-year overall survival rates</outcome> were numerically higher but not significantly improved (capecitabine, <intervention-value>93.3%</intervention-value>; control, <control-value>90.7%</control-value>). Overall, 39.1% of patients had capecitabine dose reductions, and 8.4% reported <outcome>grade ≥ 3 hand-foot syndrome</outcome>. The most common grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicities were <outcome>neutropenia</outcome> (capecitabine, <intervention-value>136</intervention-value> [<intervention-value>45.8%</intervention-value>]; control, <control-value>118</control-value> [<control-value>41.0%</control-value>]) and <outcome>febrile neutropenia</outcome> (capecitabine, <intervention-value>50</intervention-value> [<intervention-value>16.8%</intervention-value>]; control, <control-value>46</control-value> [<control-value>16.0%</control-value>]). Safety data were similar to the known capecitabine safety profile and generally comparable between arms. Capecitabine when added to 3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of a 3-drug anthracycline combination containing capecitabine instead of fluorouracil significantly improved DFS in TNBC without new safety concerns.
