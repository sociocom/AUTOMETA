Randomized trial using gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist <intervention>triptorelin</intervention> for the preservation of ovarian function during (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea is a serious concern for women undergoing cancer therapy. This prospective randomized trial evaluated the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog triptorelin to preserve ovarian function in women treated with chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. <eligibility>Premenopausal women age 44 years or younger</eligibility> were randomly assigned to receive either triptorelin or <control>no triptorelin</control> during (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and were further stratified by age (< 35, 35 to 39, > 39 years), estrogen receptor status, and chemotherapy regimen. Objectives included the <outcome-Measure>resumption of menses</outcome-Measure> and serial monitoring of <outcome-Measure>follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>inhibin A and B levels</outcome-Measure>. Targeted for 124 patients with a planned <duration>5-year</duration> follow-up, the trial was stopped for futility after <No-of-participants>49</No-of-participants> patients were enrolled (median age, <average-age>39 years</average-age>; range, 21 to 43 years); <No-of-participants>47</No-of-participants> patients were treated according to assigned groups with four cycles of adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide alone or followed by four cycles of paclitaxel or six cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide. <outcome>Menstruation resumed</outcome> in <control-value>19</control-value> (<control-value>90%</control-value>) of <control-participants>21</control-participants> patients in the control group and in <intervention-value>23</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>88%</intervention-value>) of <intervention-participants>26</intervention-participants> in the triptorelin group (P= .36). Menses returned after a median of 5.8 months (range, 1 to 19 months) after completion of chemotherapy in the triptorelin versus 5.0 months (range, 0 to 28 months) in the control arm (P= .58). <control-value>Two</control-value> patients (age 26 and 35 years at random assignment) in the control group had <outcome>spontaneous pregnancies with term deliveries</outcome>. <outcome>FSH and inhibin B levels correlated with menstrual status</outcome>. When stratified for age, estrogen receptor status, and treatment regimen, amenorrhea rates on triptorelin were comparable to those seen in the control group.
