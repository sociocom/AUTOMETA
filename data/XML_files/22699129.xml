<intervention>Perioperative intravenous lidocaine</intervention> decreases the incidence of persistent pain after breast surgery. Breast cancer surgery is associated with a high incidence of <condition>persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP)</condition>. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of intravenous (IV) lidocaine on acute and PPSP, analgesic requirements, and sensation abnormalities in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer. <No-of-participants>Thirty-six</No-of-participants> patients participated in this randomized, double-blinded study. Before induction of general anesthesia, patients received a bolus of intravenous lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of lidocaine 1.5 mg/kgh (lidocaine group) or an equal volume of saline (<control>control group</control>). The infusion was stopped 1 hour after the skin closure. <outcome-Measure>Pain scores</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>analgesic consumption</outcome-Measure> were recorded at 2, 4, 24 hours, and then daily for 1 week postoperatively. Three months later, patients were assessed for <outcome-Measure>PPSP</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>secondary hyperalgesia</outcome-Measure>. <intervention-value>Two</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>11.8%</intervention-value>) patients in the lidocaine group and <control-value>9</control-value> (<control-value>47.4%</control-value>) patients in the control group reported <outcome>PPSP</outcome> at 3 months follow-up (P=0.031). McGill Pain Questionnaire revealed greater present <outcome>pain intensity-visual analog scale</outcome> in the control group (14.6 ± 22.5 vs. 2.6 ± 7.5; P=0.025). <outcome>Secondary hyperalgesia</outcome> (area of hyperalgesia/length of surgical incision) was significantly less in the lidocaine group compared with control group (0.2 ± 0.8 vs. 3.2 ± 4.5 cm; P=0.002). The 2 groups were similar in terms of <outcome>analgesic consumption</outcome> during the early postoperative period. Intravenous perioperative lidocaine decreases the incidence and severity of PPSP after breast cancer surgery. Prevention of the induction of central hyperalgesia is a potential mechanism.
