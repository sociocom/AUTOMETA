Prescribing tamoxifen in primary care for the prevention of breast cancer: a national online survey of <intervention>GPs' attitudes</intervention>. The cancer strategy for England (2015-2020) recommends GPs prescribe tamoxifen for breast cancer primary prevention among <eligibility>women at increased risk</eligibility>. To investigate GPs' attitudes towards prescribing tamoxifen. In an online survey, GPs in <location>England</location>, <location>Northern Ireland</location>, and <location>Wales</location> (n = <No-of-participants>928</No-of-participants>) were randomised using a 2 Ã— 2 between-subjects design to read one of four vignettes describing a healthy patient seeking a tamoxifen prescription. In the vignette, the hypothetical patient's breast cancer risk (moderate versus high) and the clinician initiating the prescription (GP prescriber versus <control>secondary care clinician [SCC] prescriber</control>) were manipulated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Outcomes were <outcome-Measure>willingness to prescribe</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>comfort discussing harms and benefits</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>comfort managing the patient</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>factors affecting the prescribing decision</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>awareness of tamoxifen</outcome-Measure> and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline CG164. Half (<intervention-value>51.7%</intervention-value>) of the GPs <outcome>knew tamoxifen can reduce breast cancer risk</outcome>, and one-quarter (<control-value>24.1%</control-value>) were <outcome>aware of NICE guideline CG164</outcome>. Responders asked to initiate prescribing (GP prescriber) were less <outcome>willing to prescribe tamoxifen</outcome> than those continuing a prescription initiated in secondary care (SCC prescriber) (<intervention-value>68.9%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>84.6%</control-value>, P&lt;.001). The GP prescribers reported <outcome>less comfort discussing tamoxifen</outcome> (<intervention-value>53.4%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>62.5%</control-value>, P = 0.01). GPs willing to prescribe were more likely to be aware of the NICE guideline (P = 0.039) and to have acknowledged the benefits of tamoxifen (P&lt;.001), and were less likely to have considered its off-licence status (P&lt;.001). Initiating tamoxifen prescriptions for preventive therapy in secondary care before asking GPs to continue the patient's care may overcome some prescribing barriers.
