The effect of reusable versus <intervention>disposable draping material</intervention> on <condition>infection rates</condition> in implant-based breast reconstruction: a prospective randomized trial. Clinical infection remains a significant problem in implant-based breast reconstruction and is a physical and emotional strain to the breast reconstruction patient. Bacterial strikethrough of draping and gown material is a likely source of infection. Strategies to reduce infection in implant-based breast reconstruction are essential to improve patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to determine if a <intervention>disposable draping system</intervention> is superior to <control>reusable draping materials</control> in the prevention of implant-based breast reconstruction infection. This single-institution, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, IRB-approved study enrolled women with breast cancer who were eligible for implant-based breast reconstruction. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>clinical infection by postoperative day 30</outcome-Measure>. Secondary endpoints included <outcome-Measure>all other complications</outcome-Measure> encountered throughout the follow-up period and culture data. Demographic data recorded included patient age, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, chemotherapy, radiation, and follow-up. Procedural data recorded included procedure type, procedure length, estimated blood loss, use of acellular dermal matrix, use of muscle flap, and inpatient versus outpatient setting. From <duration>March 2010 through January 201</duration>2, <No-of-participants>107</No-of-participants> women were randomized and <No-of-participants>102</No-of-participants> completed the study. Five patients were determined not to be candidates for reconstruction after randomization. There were <control-participants>43</control-participants> patients in the Reusable Group and <intervention-participants>59</intervention-participants> patients in the Disposable Group. There were no significant differences in patient demographic data, procedural data, or the type of procedure performed between groups. In the Reusable Group, there were <control-value>5</control-value> <outcome>infections</outcome> (<control-value>12%</control-value>) within 30 days compared to <intervention-value>0</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>0%</intervention-value>) infections in the Disposable Group (P = 0.012). There was no significant difference in <outcome>secondary complications</outcome>. There was a trend for <outcome>positive wound cultures</outcome> (<intervention-value>11%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>3%</control-value>, P = 0.10) and <outcome>positive drape cultures</outcome> (<intervention-value>17%</intervention-value> vs.<control-value>4%</control-value>, P = 0.08) in patients with clinical infection. There were no differences in the <outcome>number of colony-forming units or positive cultures</outcome> between groups. Disposable draping material is superior to a reusable draping system in the prevention of clinical infection within the immediate postoperative period. This study did not demonstrate a clear link between intraoperative culture data and the development of clinical infection. A completely disposable gown and draping system is recommended during implant-based breast reconstruction.
