<intervention>Globo H-KLH vaccine adagloxad simolenin</intervention> (OBI-822)/OBI-821 in patients with metastatic breast cancer: phase II randomized, placebo-controlled study. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase II trial assessed the efficacy and safety of adagloxad simolenin (OBI-822; a Globo H epitope covalently linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)) with adjuvant OBI-821 in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). At 40 sites in <location>Taiwan, USA, Korea, India, and Hong Kong</location>, <eligibility>patients with MBC of any molecular subtype and ≤2 prior progressive disease events with stable/responding disease after the last anticancer regimen</eligibility> were randomized (2:1) to adagloxad simolenin (AS/OBI-821) or <control>placebo</control>, subcutaneously for nine doses with low-dose cyclophosphamide. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>progression-free survival (PFS)</outcome-Measure>. Secondary endpoints included <outcome-Measure>overall survival, correlation of clinical outcome with humoral immune response and Globo H expression, and safety</outcome-Measure>. Of <No-of-participants>349</No-of-participants> patients randomized, <No-of-participants>348</No-of-participants> received study drug. Patients with the following breast cancer subtypes were included: hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) (70.4%), triple negative (12.9%), and HER2+ (16.7%), similarly distributed between treatment arms. <outcome>Median PFS</outcome> was 7.6 months (95% CI: 6.5-10.9) with AS/OBI-821 (n=<intervention-participants>224</intervention-participants>) and 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.3-11.3) with placebo (n=<control-participants>124</control-participants>) (HR=0.96; 95% CI: 0.74-1.25; p=0.77), with no difference by breast cancer subtype. AS/OBI-821 recipients with anti-Globo H IgG titer ≥1:160 had significantly longer median PFS (11.1 months (95% CI: 9.3-17.6)) versus those with titers &lt;:160 (5.5 months (95% CI: 3.7-5.6); HR=0.52; p&lt;.0001) and placebo recipients (HR=0.71; p=0.03). <outcome>Anti-KLH immune responses</outcome> were similar at week 40 between AS/OBI-821 recipients with anti-Globo IgG titer ≥1:160 and those with anti-Globo IgG titer &lt;:160. The most common <outcome>adverse events</outcome> with AS/OBI-821 were <outcome>grade 1 or 2 injection site reactions</outcome> (<intervention-value>56.7%</intervention-value>; placebo, <control-value>8.9%</control-value>) and <outcome>fever</outcome> (<intervention-value>20.1%</intervention-value>; placebo, <control-value>6.5%</control-value>). AS/OBI-821 did not improve PFS in patients with previously treated MBC. However, humoral immune response to Globo H correlated with improved PFS in AS/OBI-821 recipients, leading the way to further marker-driven studies. Treatment was well tolerated.NCT01516307.
