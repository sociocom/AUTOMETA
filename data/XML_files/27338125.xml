Cost-effectiveness of a pragmatic <intervention>exercise</intervention> intervention for women with breast cancer: results from a randomized controlled trial. To report on the cost-effectiveness of the Exercise for Health trial, comparing an exercise intervention with usual care during and following treatment for women with breast cancer. <eligibility>Women with breast cancer</eligibility> were randomized to an <duration>8-month</duration> exercise intervention (involving regular contact with an exercise physiologist over the phone, n = <intervention-participants>67</intervention-participants>, or home delivered face to face, n = <intervention-participants>67</intervention-participants>) or <control>usual care</control> (n = <control-participants>60</control-participants>) group and were assessed pre-intervention (5 weeks post-surgery), mid-intervention (6 months post-surgery), and 10 weeks post-intervention (12 months post-surgery). The benefit measures were <outcome-Measure>"number of improvers" in quality of life</outcome-Measure> (FACT-B+4) and <outcome-Measure>quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)</outcome-Measure>. Data on provider, patient, and government costs were used to consider 2 cost scenarios: (1) a service provider model and (2) a private model. There were <intervention-value>69</intervention-value> <outcome>improvers</outcome> in the intervention group compared with <control-value>21</control-value> in the usual care group (odds ratio 2.09, 95% confidence interval 1.08, 4.01; P = .033). The <outcome>incremental cost per improver</outcome> was A$2282 to A$2644. <outcome>Quality-adjusted life years gain</outcome> for the intervention group versus the usual care group was 0.009, with incremental cost per QALY gain for models 1 and 2 being A$105 231 and A$90 842, respectively. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that incremental cost per QALY gained was volatile to EuroQol-5D-3L weights. Findings suggest that a pragmatic exercise intervention yields more women with markedly improved quality of life after breast cancer than usual care and may be cost-effective. The results are less certain in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years; however, this may be an inappropriate measure for reflecting exercise benefit for women with breast cancer.
