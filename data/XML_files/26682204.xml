Effect of increase in duration of <intervention>aprepitant</intervention> consumption from 3 to 6 days on the prevention of <condition>nausea and vomiting</condition> in <eligibility>women receiving combination of anthracycline/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy</eligibility>: A randomized, crossover, clinical trial. Aprepitant is one of the effective antiemetic drugs that usually used for a period of 3 days for prevention of anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (AC) induced nausea and vomiting. However, many patients still experience nausea and vomiting on days 3-5. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an increase in duration of aprepitant consumption from 3 to 6 days on the prevention of nausea and vomiting in <eligibility>women receiving AC chemotherapy</eligibility>. It was a randomized, crossover, controlled clinical trial. Women with breast cancer and scheduled to receive AC regimens were enrolled in this study. Enrolled patients were randomized into two groups. Group I received <control>3 days regimen of aprepitant</control> in the first course of AC regimen chemotherapy and 6 days regimen of aprepitant in the second course; Group II received 6 days regimen followed by 3 days regimen. For nausea and vomiting assessment, we used Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group questionnaire. <No-of-participants>Forty-nine</No-of-participants> patients were enrolled in this study. <intervention-value>Sixty-three percent</intervention-value> achieved a <outcome>complete response</outcome> with 6 days aprepitant regimen compared with <control-value>39%</control-value> with 3 days regimen (P &lt;0.001). <intervention-value>Ten percent</intervention-value> had at least one <outcome>vomiting episode</outcome> during the 6 days regimen versus <control-value>15%</control-value> with 3 days regimen (P = 0.034). Nausea was significantly more severe in 3 days regimen of aprepitant than in 6 days regimen. Increase in the duration of aprepitant consumption through 6 days resulted in significantly better prevention of nausea and vomiting than 3 days consumption for women receiving AC chemotherapy.
