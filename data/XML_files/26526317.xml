<intervention>Stress management</intervention> reduces <condition>intraindividual cortisol variability</condition>, while not impacting other measures of cortisol rhythm, in a group of women at risk for breast cancer. The stress hormone cortisol exhibits a diurnal rhythm throughout the day, as well as within person variability. Recent statistical approaches allow for the estimation of intraindividual cortisol variability ("ICV") and a greater ICV has been observed in some mood disorders (major depression, remitted bipolar disorder); however, ICV has not been examined following stress management. In this secondary analyses of an efficacious randomized clinical trial, we examine how ICV may change after cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) <eligibility>among healthy stressed women at risk for breast cancer</eligibility>. Second, we concurrently compare other calculations of cortisol that may change following CBSM. Multilevel modeling (MLM) was applied to estimate ICV and to test for a group by time interaction from baseline, post-intervention, to 1 month following CBSM. <intervention-participants>Forty-four</intervention-participants> women were randomized to the CBSM; <control-participants>47</control-participants> to the <control>comparison group</control>; mean age of the entire group was 44.2 (SD=10.27). After controlling for relevant covariates, a significant time by group interaction emerged (β estimate=-.070; p&lt;lt;.05), such that CBSM participants demonstrated a lower <outcome>ICV</outcome> following CBSM compared to the comparison group. The interaction for cortisol slope and cortisol output (area under the curve) approached significance (β estimates=-.10 and -.062, respectively; p's<&lt;.08), while other cortisol outcomes tested were not significantly changed following CBSM. ICV may represent a novel index of cortisol dysregulation that is impacted by CBSM and may represent a more malleable within-person calculation than other, widely applied cortisol outcomes. Future research should examine these relationships in larger samples, and examine ICV and health outcomes. NCT01048528.
