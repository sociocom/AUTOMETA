<intervention>Topical silymarin</intervention> administration for prevention of <condition>acute radiodermatitis</condition> in breast cancer patients: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Radiation-induced dermatitis is one of the most common side effects of radiotherapy. Silymarin, a flavonoid extracted from the Silybum marianum, exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of silymarin gel in prevention of radiodermatitis in patients with breast cancer. During this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the preventive effect of silymarin 1% gel was assessed in comparison with <control>placebo</control>, on radiodermatitis occurrence. <No-of-participants>Forty</No-of-participants> patients randomly received silymarin gel or placebo formulation on chest wall skin following modified radical mastectomy, once daily starting at the first day of radiotherapy for <duration>5 weeks</duration>. <outcome-Measure>Radiodermatitis severity</outcome-Measure> was assessed weekly based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) criteria radiodermatits grading scale for 5 weeks. The <outcome-Measure>median NCI-CTCAE and RTOG scores</outcome-Measure> were significantly lower in silymarin group at the end of the third to fifth weeks (p value &lt; 0.05). The <outcome>scores increased significantly</outcome> in both placebo and silymarin groups during radiotherapy, but there was a delay in radiodermatitis development and progression in silymarin group. Prophylactic administration of silymarin gel could significantly reduce the severity of radiodermatitis and delay its occurrence after 5 weeks of application.
