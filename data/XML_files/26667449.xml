Double-Blind, Randomized Trial of Alternative <intervention>Letrozole</intervention> Dosing Regimens in <eligibility>Postmenopausal Women with Increased Breast Cancer Risk</eligibility>. Aromatase inhibitors (AI) profoundly suppress estrogen levels in postmenopausal women and are effective in breast cancer prevention among high-risk postmenopausal women. Unfortunately, AI treatment is associated with undesirable side effects that limit patient acceptance for primary prevention of breast cancer. A double-blind, randomized trial was conducted to determine whether low and intermittent doses of letrozole can achieve effective estrogen suppression with a more favorable side-effect profile. Overall, <No-of-participants>112</No-of-participants> postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer were randomized to receive letrozole at 2.5 mg once daily (QD, <control>standard dose arm</control>), 2.5 mg every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (Q-MWF), 1.0 mg Q-MWF, or 0.25 mg Q-MWF for 24 weeks. Primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>suppression in serum estradiol levels</outcome-Measure> at the end of letrozole intervention. Secondary endpoints included <outcome-Measure>changes in serum estrone</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>testosterone</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>C-telopeptide (marker of bone resorption)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>lipid profile</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>quality-of-life measures (QoL)</outcome-Measure> following treatment. Significant <outcome>estrogen suppression</outcome> was observed in all dose arms with an average of 75% to 78% and 86% to 93% <outcome>reduction in serum estradiol and estrone levels</outcome>, respectively. There were no differences among dose arms with respect to <outcome>changes in C-telopeptide levels, lipid profile, adverse events (AE), or QoL measures</outcome>. We conclude that low and intermittent doses of letrozole are not inferior to standard dose in estrogen suppression and resulted in a similar side-effect profile compared with standard dose. Further studies are needed to determine the feasibility of selecting an effective AI dosing schedule with better tolerability.
