<intervention>Tamoxifen</intervention> for prevention of breast cancer: extended long-term follow-up of the IBIS-I breast cancer prevention trial. Four previously published randomised clinical trials have shown that tamoxifen can reduce the risk of breast cancer in healthy women at increased risk of breast cancer in the first 10 years of follow-up. We report the long-term follow-up of the IBIS-I trial, in which the participants and investigators remain largely masked to treatment allocation. In the IBIS-I randomised controlled trial, <eligibility>premenopausal and postmenopausal women</eligibility> <average-age>35-70 years</average-age> of age <eligibility>deemed to be at an increased risk of developing breast cancer</eligibility> were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral tamoxifen 20 mg daily or matching <control>placebo</control> for <duration>5 years</duration>. Patients were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups by telephone or fax according to a block randomisation schedule (permuted block sizes of six or ten). Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment by use of central randomisation and coded drug supply. The primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>occurrence of breast cancer (invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ)</outcome-Measure>, analysed by intention to treat. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess breast cancer occurrence and mortality. The trial is closed to recruitment and active treatment is completed, but long-term follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with controlledtrials.com, number ISRCTN91879928. <duration>Between April 14, 1992, and March 30, 2001</duration>, <No-of-participants>7154</No-of-participants> eligible women recruited from genetics clinics and breast care clinics in eight countries were enrolled into the IBIS-I trial and were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups: <intervention-participants>3579</intervention-participants> to tamoxifen and <control-participants>3575</control-participants> to placebo. After a median follow up of 16.0 years (IQR 14.1-17.6), 601 <outcome>breast cancers</outcome> have been reported (<intervention-value>251</intervention-value> [<intervention-value>7.0%</intervention-value>] in <intervention-participants>3579</intervention-participants> patients in the tamoxifen group vs <control-value>350</control-value> [<control-value>9.8%</control-value>] in <control-participants>3575</control-participants> women in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 0.71 [95% CI 0.60-0.83], p&lt;.0001). The <outcome>risk of developing breast cancer</outcome> was similar between <outcome>years 0-10</outcome> (<control-value>226</control-value> [<control-value>6.3%</control-value>] in <control-participants>3575</control-participants> women in the placebo group vs <intervention-value>163</intervention-value> [<intervention-value>4.6%</intervention-value>] in <intervention-participants>3579</intervention-participants> women in the tamoxifen group; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72 [95% CI 0.59-0.88], p=0.001) and <outcome>after 10 years</outcome> (<control-value>124</control-value> [<control-value>3.8%</control-value>] in <control-participants>3295</control-participants> women vs <intervention-value>88</intervention-value> [<intervention-value>2.6%</intervention-value>] in <intervention-participants>3343</intervention-participants>, respectively; HR 0.69 [0.53-0.91], p=0.009). The greatest reduction in risk was seen in <outcome>invasive oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer</outcome> (HR 0.66 [95% CI 0.54-0.81], p&lt;.0001) and <outcome>ductal carcinoma in situ</outcome> (0.65 [0.43-1.00], p=0.05), but no effect was noted for <outcome>invasive oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer</outcome> (HR 1.05 [95% CI 0.71-1.57], p=0.8). These results show that tamoxifen offers a very long period of protection after treatment cessation, and thus substantially improves the benefit-to-harm ratio of the drug for breast cancer prevention.
