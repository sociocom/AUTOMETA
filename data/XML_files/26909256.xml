Prevention of <condition>anastrozole induced bone loss</condition> with monthly oral <intervention>ibandronate</intervention>: Final <duration>5 year</duration> results from the ARIBON trial. The ARIBON trial is a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study designed to evaluate the impact of ibandronate on bone mineral density (BMD) in women taking anastrozole for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. <No-of-participants>131</No-of-participants> <eligibility>postmenopausal women with early breast cancer</eligibility> were recruited to the study. Of these, <No-of-participants>13</No-of-participants> had osteoporosis, <No-of-participants>50</No-of-participants> osteopenia and <No-of-participants>68</No-of-participants> normal BMD. Patients with osteoporosis at baseline were treated with monthly oral ibandronate 150Â mg for 5 years; osteopenic patients were randomised to receive either ibandronate or <control>placebo</control> for two years and offered open label ibandronate depending upon the results of their 2-year BMD result. Of the <intervention-participants>20</intervention-participants> patients with osteopenia who were randomised to ibandronate and evaluable at the 2 year visit, <intervention-value>17</intervention-value>/<intervention-participants>20</intervention-participants> were not offered a bisphosphonate and the <outcome>improvements in BMD</outcome> accrued during the first 2 years were lost both at the LS (-3.21%) and TH (-5.0%). Of the <control-participants>16</control-participants> patients randomised to placebo <control-value>8</control-value>/<control-participants>16</control-participants> with high rates of bone loss during years 0-2 received ibandronate over the next 3 years with <outcome>improvements in BMD</outcome> of +5.01 and +1.19 at the LS and TH respectively. The <control-participants>8</control-participants> patients who were not offered a bisphosphonate experienced relatively little <outcome>change in BMD</outcome> throughout the 5 years of the study (LS +0.15%, TH -2.72%). <outcome>BMD increased</outcome> steadily in the <intervention-value>9</intervention-value>/<intervention-participants>13</intervention-participants> patients initially identified as having osteoporosis (LS +9.65%, TH +2.72%). Monthly oral ibandronate provides an option to clinicians considering use of a bisphosphonate to prevent bone loss during aromatase inhibitor therapy.
