Long-term safety and survival outcomes from the Scandinavian Breast Group 2004-1 randomized phase II trial of <intervention>tailored dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy</intervention> for early breast cancer. Although adjuvant polychemotherapy improves outcomes for early breast cancer, the significant variability in terms of pharmacokinetics results in differences in efficacy and both short and long-term toxicities. Retrospective studies support the use of dose tailoring according to the hematologic nadirs. The SBG 2004-1 trial was a randomized feasibility phase II study which assessed tailored dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel (T) (group A), the same regimen with fixed doses (group B) and the <control>TAC regimen</control> (group C). Women aged <average-age>18-65 years</average-age>, <eligibility>ECOG PS 0-1 with at least one positive axillary lymph node</eligibility> were randomized 1:1:1. The primary endpoint of the study was the <outcome-Measure>safety and feasibility of the treatment</outcome-Measure>. <outcome-Measure>Toxicity</outcome-Measure> was graded according to CTC-AE version 3.0. The design and short-term toxicity have been previously published. Here, we report safety and efficacy data after 10 years of follow-up. A total of <No-of-participants>124</No-of-participants> patients were included in the study. After a median follow-up of <duration>10.3 years</duration>, the <outcome>probability for 10-year survival</outcome> was <intervention-value>78.5</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>75.1</intervention-value>, and <control-value>63.4%</control-value> and for <outcome>relapse free survival</outcome> <intervention-value>64.1</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>71.0</intervention-value>, and <control-value>59.5%</control-value> for groups A, B, and C, respectively. There were <outcome>no cases of clinically diagnosed cardiotoxicity or hematologic malignancies</outcome>. <outcome>No patient was lost to follow-up</outcome>. In this randomized phase II trial, tailored dose adjuvant chemotherapy was feasible, without an increased risk for long-term adverse events after a median follow-up of 10 years.
