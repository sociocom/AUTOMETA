A <intervention>Restorative Yoga</intervention> Intervention for <ethinicity>African-American</ethinicity> Breast Cancer Survivors: a Pilot Study. Data show that yoga is effective for improving health-related outcomes in breast cancer survivors. While breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among African-American women (AAW), AAW are less likely to engage in yoga compared to other ethnic groups. The goals of the current study were to assess the feasibility of an <duration>8-week</duration> restorative yoga program among <eligibility>African-American breast cancer survivors (AA BCS)</eligibility>. Specifically, study aims were to (1) measure changes in study outcomes in a restorative yoga (RY) group compared to a wait list control group, (2) assess adherence to the RY program, and (3) assess program satisfaction among study participants. <No-of-participants>Thirty-three</No-of-participants> AA BCS were randomly assigned to either the RY intervention (n = <intervention-participants>18</intervention-participants>) or <control-participants>wait list control group</control-participants> (n = <control-participants>15</control-participants>). RY classes met once per week for <duration>8 weeks</duration>. Pre- and post-testing assessments were measured at 0 and 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention). <outcome>Depression scores</outcome> at follow-up were significantly lower in the yoga group (M = 4.78, SD = 3.56) compared to the control group (M = 6.91, SD = 5.86). No significant group differences were observed for <outcome>sleep quality, fatigue, or perceived stress</outcome>. Yoga program participants completing baseline assessments demonstrated 61% <outcome>adherence</outcome> to the yoga classes. <outcome>Average rating</outcome> of the yoga program was "very useful." Recommendations for future yoga programs were provided. This study suggests that yoga has a beneficial effect on depression in AA BCS. There is, however, a need to further explore the benefits of yoga among minority breast cancer survivors using a study with larger sample sizes.
