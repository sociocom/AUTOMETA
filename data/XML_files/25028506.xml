A randomized phase II presurgical trial of <intervention>transdermal 4-hydroxytamoxifen gel</intervention> versus oral <control>tamoxifen</control> in <eligibility>women with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast</eligibility>. Local transdermal therapy to the breast may achieve effective target-organ drug delivery, while diminishing systemic effects. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial comparing transdermal 4-hydroxytamoxifen gel (4-OHT) to oral tamoxifen (oral-T) in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). <No-of-participants>Twenty-seven</No-of-participants> pre- and postmenopausal women were randomized to 4-OHT (4 mg/day) or oral-T (20 mg/day) for <duration>6 to 10 weeks</duration> before surgery. Plasma, nipple aspirate fluid, and breast adipose tissue concentrations of tamoxifen and its major metabolites were determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>Ki67 labeling in DCIS lesions</outcome-Measure>, measured by immunohistochemistry. In <outcome-Measure>plasma</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGFI),</outcome-Measure> <outcome-Measure>sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>coagulation protein concentrations</outcome-Measure> were determined. <outcome>Posttherapy Ki67 decreased</outcome> by <intervention-value>3.4%</intervention-value> in the 4-OHT and <control-value>5.1%</control-value> in the oral-T group (P â‰¤ 0.03 in both, between-group P = 0. 99). <outcome>Mean plasma 4-OHT</outcome> was 0.2 and 1.1 ng/mL in 4-OHT and oral groups, respectively (P = 0.0003), whereas <outcome>mean breast adipose tissue concentrations of 4-OHT</outcome> were 5.8 ng/g in the 4-OHT group and 5.4 ng/g in the oral group (P = 0.88). There were significant increases in <outcome>plasma SHBG, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor</outcome> and a significant decrease in <outcome>plasma IGFI with oral-T</outcome>, but not with 4-OHT. The incidence of <adverse-effect>hot flashes</adverse-effect> was similar in both groups. The antiproliferative effect of 4-OHT gel applied to breast skin was similar to that of oral-T, but effects on endocrine and coagulation parameters were reduced. These findings support the further evaluation of local transdermal therapy for DCIS and breast cancer prevention.
