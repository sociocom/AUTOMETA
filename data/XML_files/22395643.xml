<intervention>CYP2D6</intervention> and <intervention>UGT2B7</intervention> genotype and risk of recurrence in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy substantially decreases the risk of recurrence and mortality in women with hormone (estrogen and/or progesterone) receptor-positive breast cancer. Previous studies have suggested that metabolic conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is required for patient benefit from tamoxifen therapy. Tumor specimens from a subset of <eligibility>postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive early-stage (stages I, II, and IIIA) breast cancer</eligibility>, who were enrolled in the randomized double-blind <intervention>Arimidex</intervention>, <intervention>Tamoxifen</intervention>, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) clinical trial, were genotyped for variants in CYP2D6 (N = <No-of-participants>1203</No-of-participants> patients: anastrozole [trade name: Arimidex] group, n = <intervention-participants>615</intervention-participants> patients; tamoxifen group, n = <control-participants>588</control-participants> patients) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-2B7 (UGT2B7), whose gene product inactivates endoxifen (N = <No-of-participants>1209</No-of-participants> patients; anastrozole group, n = <intervention-participants>606</intervention-participants> patients; tamoxifen group, n = <control-participants>603</control-participants> patients). Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-based TaqMan assays. Based on the genotypes for CYP2D6, patients were classified as poor metabolizer (PM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), or extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotypes. We evaluated the association of CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 genotype with <outcome-Measure>distant recurrence</outcome-Measure> (primary endpoint) and <outcome-Measure>any recurrence</outcome-Measure> (secondary endpoint) by estimating the hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazards models. All statistical tests were two-sided. After a median follow-up of 10 years, <outcome>no statistically significant associations were observed between CYP2D6 genotype and recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients</outcome> (PM vs EM: HR for distant recurrence = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.55 to 3.15, P = .64; HR for any recurrence = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.48 to 2.08, P = .99). A <outcome>near-null association was observed between UGT2B7 genotype and recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients</outcome>. <outcome>No associations were observed between CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 genotypes and recurrence in anastrozole-treated patients</outcome>. The results do not support the hypothesis that CYP2D6 genotype predicts clinical benefit of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment among postmenopausal breast cancer patients.
