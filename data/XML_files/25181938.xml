A clinical randomized controlled trial of <intervention>music therapy</intervention> and <intervention>progressive muscle relaxation training</intervention> in <eligibility>female breast cancer patients after radical mastectomy</eligibility>: results on depression, anxiety and length of hospital stay. To examine effects of music therapy and progressive muscle relaxation training on <condition>depression, anxiety and length of hospital stay</condition> in <ethinicity>Chinese</ethinicity> female breast cancer patients after radical mastectomy. A total of <No-of-participants>170</No-of-participants> patients were randomly allocated to the intervention group (n = <intervention-participants>85</intervention-participants>) receiving music therapy and progressive muscle relaxation training plus routine nursing care and the <control>control group</control> (n = <control-participants>85</control-participants>) receiving <control>routine nursing care</control>. Music therapy and progressive muscle relaxation training were performed twice a day within 48 h after radical mastectomy, once in the early morning (6a.m.-8a.m.) and once in the evening (9p.m.-11p.m.), for 30 min per session until discharged from the hospital. A general linear model with univariate analysis showed that the intervention group patients had significant <outcome>improvement in depression and anxiety</outcome> in the effects of group (F = 20.31, P &lt;0.001; F = 5.41, P = 0.017), time (F = 56.64, P &lt;0.001; F = 155.17, P &lt;0.001) and group*time interaction (F = 6.91, P = 0.009; F = 5.56, P = 0.019). The intervention group patients had <outcome>shorter length of hospital stay</outcome> (12.56 ± 1.03) than that of the control group (17.01 ± 2.46) with statistical significance (F = 13.36, P &lt;0.001). Music therapy and progressive muscle relaxation training can reduce depression, anxiety and length of hospital stay in female breast cancer patients after radical mastectomy.
