Uptake of <intervention>tamoxifen</intervention> in <eligibility>consecutive premenopausal women under surveillance in a high-risk breast cancer clinic</eligibility>. Randomised trials of tamoxifen versus <control>placebo</control> indicate that tamoxifen reduces breast cancer risk by approximately 33%, yet uptake is low. Approximately 10% of women in our clinic entered the IBIS-I prevention trial. We assess the uptake of tamoxifen in a consecutive series of premenopausal women not in a trial and explore the reasons for uptake through interviews. All eligible women <average-age>between 33 and 46 years</average-age> <eligibility>at â‰¥17% lifetime risk of breast cancer and undergoing annual mammography</eligibility> in our service were invited to take a 5-year course of tamoxifen. Reasons for accepting (n=15) or declining (n=15) were explored using semi-structured interviews. Of <No-of-participants>1279</No-of-participants> eligible women, <intervention-value>136</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>10.6%</intervention-value>) <outcome>decided to take tamoxifen</outcome>. <outcome>Women >40 years</outcome> (<intervention-value>74</intervention-value> out of <intervention-participants>553</intervention-participants> (<intervention-value>13.4%</intervention-value>)) and those <outcome>at higher non-BRCA-associated risk</outcome> were more likely to <outcome>accept tamoxifen</outcome> (<intervention-value>129</intervention-value> out of <intervention-participants>1109</intervention-participants> (<intervention-value>11.6%</intervention-value>)). Interviews highlighted four themes surrounding decision making: perceived impact of side effects, the impact of others' experience on beliefs about tamoxifen, tamoxifen as a 'cancer drug', and daily reminder of cancer risk. Tamoxifen uptake was similar to previously ascertained uptake in a randomised controlled trial (IBIS-I). Concerns were similar in women who did or did not accept tamoxifen. Decision making appeared to be embedded in the experience of significant others.
