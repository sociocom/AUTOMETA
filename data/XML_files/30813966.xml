Patterns of occurrence and implications of <condition>neratinib-associated diarrhea</condition> in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer: analyses from the randomized phase III ExteNET trial. We characterized patterns of occurrence and the impact of neratinib-associated diarrhea in the absence of protocol-directed antidiarrheal prophylaxis or a formal diarrhea management plan using data from Extended Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer with Neratinib (ExteNET). ExteNET is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial involving community-based and academic institutions in 40 countries. <eligibility>Women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer with prior standard primary therapy and trastuzumab-based (neo)adjuvant therapy</eligibility> were randomized to <intervention>neratinib</intervention> 240 mg/day or <control>placebo</control> for <duration>12 months</duration>. <outcome-Measure>Safety</outcome-Measure>, a secondary outcome, was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0. <outcome-Measure>Health-related quality of life by diarrhea grade</outcome-Measure> was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B). <No-of-participants>Two thousand eight hundred sixtee</No-of-participants>n women (<intervention-participants>1408</intervention-participa<control-participants>nts></control-participants> per group) were safety-evaluable. <outcome>Grade 3 and 4 diarrhea</outcome> occurred in <intervention-value>561</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>39.8%</intervention-value>) and <intervention-value>1</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>0.1%</intervention-value>) patients with neratinib versus <control-value>23</control-value> (<control-value>1.6%</control-value>) and <control-value>0</control-value> patients with placebo, respectively. In the neratinib group, <intervention-value>28.6%</intervention-value> of patients had <outcome>grade 3 events</outcome> during month 1 decreasing to ≤ 6% after month 3. The median <outcome>cumulative duration of grade 3/4 diarrhea</outcome> with neratinib was 5 days (interquartile range, 2-9). <outcome>Serious diarrheal events</outcome> (n = <intervention-value>22</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>1.6%</intervention-value>) and <outcome>diarrheal events requiring hospitalization</outcome> (n = <intervention-value>20</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>1.4%</intervention-value>) were rare with neratinib. Changes in FACT-B total score by diarrhea grade in the neratinib group did not meet the threshold for clinically important differences. In the absence of antidiarrheal prophylaxis, neratinib-related diarrhea is short-lived and not associated with complications or long-term sequelae. This suggests that targeted preventive management with antidiarrheal prophylaxis early during neratinib treatment is appropriate. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00878709. Registered 9 April 2009.
