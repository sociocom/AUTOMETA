<duration>Fifteen-year</duration> results of a randomized phase III trial of <intervention>fenretinide</intervention> to prevent second breast cancer. The synthetic retinoid fenretinide administered for 5 years for prevention of second breast cancer showed no difference after a median of 8 years, but a possible reduction in premenopausal women. We conducted a long-term analysis in a subgroup of women who were regularly followed up in a single center. We analyzed data after a median follow-up of 14.6 years (IQ range, 12.3-16.3 years) from <No-of-participants>1739</No-of-participants> women <average-age>aged 30-70</average-age> (<intervention-participants>872</intervention-participants> in the fenretinide arm and <control-participants>867</control-participants> in the <control>observation</control> arm), representing 60% of the initial cohort of 2867 women. The main efficacy endpoint was <outcome-Measure>second primary breast cancer</outcome-Measure> (contralateral or ipsilateral). The <outcome>number of second breast cancers</outcome> was <intervention-value>168</intervention-value> in the fenretinide arm and <control-value>190</control-value> in the control arm (hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.67-1.03). There were <intervention-value>83</intervention-value> events in the fenretinide arm and <control-value>126</control-value> in the observation arm <outcome>in premenopausal women</outcome> (HR = 0.62, 95% CI, 0.46-0.83), and <intervention-value>85</intervention-value> and <control-value>64</control-value> events <outcome>in postmenopausal women</outcome> (HR = 1.23, 95% CI, 0.63-2.40). The younger were the women, the greater was the risk reduction associated with fenretinide, which attained 50% in women aged 40 years or younger and disappeared after age 55 (P-age*treatment interaction = 0.023). There was no <outcome>difference in cancers in other organs, distant metastases or survival</outcome>. Fenretinide induces a significant risk reduction of second breast cancer in premenopausal women, which is remarkable at younger ages, and persists several years after treatment cessation. Since adverse events are limited, a trial in young women at high-risk is warranted.
