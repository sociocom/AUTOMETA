Efficacy of <intervention>gabapentin</intervention> for the prevention of <condition>paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy</condition>: A randomized placebo controlled clinical trial. Neuropathy is a dose limiting side effect of taxanes which may impact the quality of life and treatment outcomes. This randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded clinical trial was carried out to assess the efficacy of gabapentin in preventing chemotherapy induced neuropathy. <eligibility>Women with breast cancer</eligibility> were randomized into two groups of paclitaxel chemotherapy with gabapentin 300 mg/three times a day orally or <control>placebo</control> for <duration>2 weeks</duration> started at day 1 of each paclitaxel cycle. Two groups were compared based on the <outcome-Measure>relative frequency of neuropathy</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>change in nerve conducting velocity (NCV)</outcome-Measure>. <intervention-participants>Twenty</intervention-partici<control-participants>pants></control-participants> women were assigned to each study arm. The majority of the <outcome>neuropathy</outcome> in gabapentin group was grade 1 in all of the four cycles with no event of ≥grade 3 neuropathy in this group. Compared to the placebo, the <outcome>rate of 2nd and 3rd grade neuropathy</outcome> was significantly lower in the gabapentin group (P = 0.000). The <outcome>change in NCV</outcome> after four cycles of paclitaxel was significantly lower in the gabapentin group compared to the placebo group (<intervention-value>17.7%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>61.0%</control-value> <outcome>decline in NCV for sural</outcome> and <intervention-value>21.9%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>62.5%</control-value> <outcome>declines in NCV for peroneal nerve</outcome>). Gabapentin given with paclitaxel is effective in the prevention of intermediate and high grade neuropathies both objectively and subjectively.
