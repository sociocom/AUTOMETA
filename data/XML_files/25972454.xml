Phase II double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study of <intervention>armodafinil</intervention> for <condition>brain radiation-induced fatigue</condition>. Common acute-term side effects of brain radiotherapy (RT) include fatigue, drowsiness, decreased physical functioning, and decreased quality of life (QOL). We hypothesized that armodafinil (a wakefulness-promoting drug known to reduce fatigue and increase cognitive function in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy) would result in reduced fatigue and sleepiness for patients receiving brain RT. A phase II, multi-institutional, placebo-controlled randomized trial assessed feasibility of armodafinil 150 mg/day in <eligibility>participants receiving brain RT</eligibility>, from whom we obtained estimates of variability for fatigue, sleepiness, QOL, cognitive function, and treatment effect. <duration>From September 20, 2010, to October 20, 2012</duration>, <No-of-participants>54</No-of-participants> participants enrolled with 80% retention and 94% self-reported compliance. There were no <outcome>grade 4-5 toxicities</outcome>, and the <outcome>incidence of grade 2-3 toxicities</outcome> was similar between treatment arms, the most common of which were anxiety and <outcome>nausea</outcome> (15%), <outcome>headaches</outcome> (19%), and <outcome>insomnia</outcome> (20%). There were no statistically significant differences in <outcome>end-RT or 4 week post-RT</outcome> outcomes between armodafinil and placebo in any outcomes (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy [FACIT]-Fatigue, Brief Fatigue Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, FACT-Brain, and FACIT-cognitive function). However, in participants with more baseline fatigue, those treated with armodafinil did better than those who received the placebo on the end-RT assessments for several outcomes. Armodafinil 150 mg/day was <outcome>well tolerated</outcome> in primary brain tumor patients undergoing RT with good compliance. While there was <outcome>no overall significant effect on fatigue</outcome>, those with greater baseline fatigue experienced improved QOL and reduced fatigue when using armodafinil. These data suggest that a prospective, phase III randomized trial is warranted for patients with greater baseline fatigue.
