Randomised Phase 2 study of <intervention>lapatinib and vinorelbine</intervention> vs <control>vinorelbine</control> in <eligibility>patients with HER2 + metastatic breast cancer after lapatinib and trastuzumab treatment</eligibility> (KCSG BR11-16). The continuum of anti-HER2 agents is a standard treatment of HER2 + metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This study evaluated the efficacy of lapatinib plus vinorelbine in patients progressed on both trastuzumab and lapatinib treatments. A total of <No-of-participants>149</No-of-participants> patients were randomly assigned to lapatinib with vinorelbine (LV) (n = 75; lapatinib, 1000 mg daily; vinorelbine 20 mg/m2 D1, D8 q3w) or vinorelbine (V) (n = 74; 30 mg/m2 D1, D8 q3w). The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 18 weeks</outcome-Measure>. The median number of previous anti-HER2 therapies was 2 (range 2-5). There was no significant difference in <outcome>PFS rate at 18 weeks</outcome> between LV and V arms (<intervention-value>45.9%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>38.9%</control-value>, p = 0.40). <outcome>ORR</outcome> was <intervention-value>19.7%</intervention-value> in LV arm, and <control-value>16.9%</control-value> in V arm (p = 0.88). PFS and OS did not differ between two arms (LV vs V; median PFS, 16 vs 12 weeks, HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.61-1.22; median OS, 15.0 vs 18.9 months, HR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.72-1.58). <outcome>Toxicity profiles</outcome> were similar in both arms and all were manageable. Lapatinib plus vinorelbine treatment was tolerable; however, it failed to demonstrate the clinical benefits over vinorelbine alone in patients with HER2 + MBC after progression on both trastuzumab and lapatinib. ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01730677.
