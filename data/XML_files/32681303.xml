<ethinicity>Hispanic</ethinicity> ethnicity as a moderator of the effects of <intervention>aerobic and resistance exercise</intervention> on physical fitness and quality-of-life in <eligibility>breast cancer survivors</eligibility>. Exercise can profoundly affect physical fitness and quality of life in breast cancer survivors; however, few studies have focused on minorities. This secondary analysis examines Hispanic ethnicity as a moderator of the effects of a 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise intervention on physical fitness and quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Eligible breast cancer survivors (n = <No-of-participants>100</No-of-participants>) were randomized to exercise (n = <intervention-participants>50</intervention-participants>) or <control>usual care</control> (n =<control-participants> 50</control-participants>). The exercise intervention consisted of supervised moderate-vigorous aerobic and resistance exercise thrice weekly for <duration>16 weeks</duration>. <outcome-Measure>Physical fitness and quality of life</outcome-Measure> were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and 28-week follow-up (exercise only). Linear mixed-models adjusted for baseline value of the outcome, age, disease stage, adjuvant treatment, and recent physical activity were used to evaluate effect modification by ethnicity. The study sample included 57% Hispanic and 43% <ethinicity>non-Hispanic</ethinicity> breast cancer survivors. Hispanic breast cancer survivors were younger, less fit, and diagnosed with more advanced cancers compared with non-Hispanic breast cancer survivors (p &lt; 0.001). Ethnicity was found to moderate the effects of exercise training on all physical fitness and quality-of-life measures including <outcome>VO2max</outcome> (8.4 mL/kg/min; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3.2 to 13.4), <outcome>physical well-being</outcome> (12.3; 95% CI 4.2 to 18.4), and <outcome>emotional well-being</outcome> (11.4; 95% CI 5.9 to 15.5). In all cases, Hispanics experienced larger benefits than non-Hispanics. Hispanic breast cancer survivors have poorer cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and quality-of-life and therefore may derive larger benefits from exercise than non-Hispanic breast cancer survivors. Clinical exercise interventions may attenuate existing health disparities among minority breast cancer survivors. Here we report psychosocial and fitness-related disparities among Hispanic breast cancer survivors when compared with their non-Hispanic counterparts. Our exercise intervention highlights the importance of exercise for minority cancer survivors and the need for distinct, culturally tailored exercise intervention approaches to reduce psychosocial and fitness-related disparities among this understudied population of cancer survivors.
