A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase II, Presurgical Biomarker Trial of <intervention>Celecoxib</intervention> Versus <intervention>Exemestane</intervention> in Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Patients. In breast cancer presurgical trials, the Ki-67 labeling index predicts disease outcome and offers clues to the preventive potential of drugs. We conducted a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the activity of exemestane and celecoxib before surgery. The main endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>change in Ki-67</outcome-Measure>. Secondary endpoints were the <outcome-Measure>modulation of circulating biomarkers</outcome-Measure>. Postmenopausal women with histologically confirmed estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg/day (n = <intervention-participants>50</intervention-participants>), or celecoxib 800 mg/day (n = <intervention-participants>50</intervention-participants>), or <control>placebo</control> (n = <control-participants>25</control-participants>) for 6 weeks before surgery. Changes in biomarkers were analyzed through an ANCOVA model adjusting for baseline values. Exemestane showed a median absolute <intervention-value>10%</intervention-value> <outcome>reduction in Ki-67</outcome> [from 22 (interquartile range, IQR, 16-27), to 8 (IQR 5-18)], and a <intervention-value>15%</intervention-value> absolute <outcome>reduction in PgR expression</outcome> [from 50 (IQR 3-90) to 15 (IQR -0-30)] after 6 weeks of treatment. Exemestane significantly <outcome>increased testosterone</outcome> [median change 0.21 ng/mL, (IQR 0.12-0.35)], <outcome>decreased SHBG</outcome> [median change -14.6 nmol/L, (IQR -23.1 to -8.6)], <outcome>decreased total and HDL cholesterol</outcome> by -10 mg/dL (IQR -21-2) and -7 mg/dL, (IQR -14 to -2), respectively. <outcome>Triglycerides</outcome> were reduced by both agents [median change -0.5 mg/dL (IQR -17.5-13.5) and -8 mg/dL (IQR -28-9) for celecoxib and exemestane, respectively]. Exemestane showed a remarkable antiproliferative effect on breast cancer, whereas celecoxib did not affect breast cancer proliferation. Given the proven preventive efficacy of exemestane, these findings support the use of Ki-67 to explore the optimal exemestane dose and schedule in the prevention setting.
