Can <intervention>Dietary</intervention> and <intervention>Physical Activity</intervention> Modifications Reduce Breast Density in Postmenopausal Women? The DAMA Study, a Randomized Intervention Trial in Italy. Few randomized trials have been carried out to evaluate the effect of lifestyle modifications on mammographic breast density (MBD). The randomized 2 Ã— 2 factorial Diet, physical Activity and MAmmography trial aimed to evaluate whether MBD can be reduced in postmenopausal women with high baseline MBD by a <duration>24-month</duration> dietary and/or physical activity (PA) interventions. We randomized <eligibility>healthy postmenopausal women</eligibility>, attending the <location>Florence (Italy)</location> mammographic screening program, ages <average-age>50 to 69 years</average-age>, <eligibility>nonsmokers, with MBD > 50% and no recent hormone therapy</eligibility>, to (i) a dietary intervention focused on plant foods, with a low glycemic load, low in saturated fats and alcohol; (ii) a PA intervention combining daily moderate intensity activities and one weekly supervised session of more strenuous activity; (iii) both interventions; (iv) general recommendations. We evaluated <outcome-Measure>changes in MBD based on Volpara estimates</outcome-Measure> comparing baseline and follow-up digital mammograms by an intention-to-treat-analysis. MBD measures were available for <No-of-participants>226</No-of-participants> participants. An interaction emerged between treatments and thus we run analyses by arms. A <outcome>decrease in volumetric percent density</outcome> emerged for women in the dietary intervention (ratio 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.97; P = 0.002) and in the PA intervention arm (0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98; P = 0.01) in comparison with controls. No clear effect emerged in the double intervention arm. This intervention trial suggests that a 24-month dietary or PA intervention may reduce MBD in postmenopausal women. A modification of dietary habits or an increase in PA in postmenopausal women may reduce MBD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings for planning breast cancer preventive strategies.
