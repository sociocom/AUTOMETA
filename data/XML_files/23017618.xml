<intervention>Bupropion</intervention> for control of <condition>hot flashes</condition> in breast cancer survivors: a prospective, double-blind, randomized, crossover, pilot phase II trial. Hot flashes (HFs) and sexual dysfunction often affect breast cancer (BC) survivors and compromise their quality of life. Bupropion is an antidepressive medication used for smoking cessation and also has been previously studied for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. We aimed to evaluate bupropion's efficacy in controlling HFs in BC survivors. This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled pilot study that enrolled <No-of-participants>55</No-of-participants> <eligibility>BC survivors who reported more than seven HFs per week</eligibility>. Subjects were randomized to receive either bupropion 150mg twice daily for four weeks followed by one week of washout and four more weeks of <control>placebo</control> twice daily or vice versa. The primary end point was <outcome-Measure>average daily HF activity</outcome-Measure> (number of HFs and a score combining number and severity) reported while on bupropion or on placebo. Secondary end points were <outcome-Measure>sexual dysfunction</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>depression</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>quality of life</outcome-Measure> evaluated with the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, respectively. Bupropion reduced <outcome>HFs</outcome> by <intervention-value>1.26</intervention-value> per day and the <outcome>HF score</outcome> by <intervention-value>6.31%</intervention-value>, whereas placebo reduced <outcome>HFs</outcome> by <control-value>2.11</control-value> per day (P>0.05) and the <outcome>HF score</outcome> by <control-value>30.47%</control-value> (P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between bupropion and placebo in the Arizona <outcome>Sexual Experience Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30</outcome>. At the end of the study, <intervention-value>47%</intervention-value> of the <outcome>patients preferred bupropion</outcome>, whereas <control-value>53%</control-value> <outcome>preferred placebo</outcome>. There were no statistically significant differences in side effects between the study groups. Compared with placebo, bupropion did not control HFs in this group of BC survivors.
