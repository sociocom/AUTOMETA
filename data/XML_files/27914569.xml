Treatment with <intervention>Ruta graveolens 5CH</intervention> and <intervention>Rhus toxicodendron 9CH</intervention> may reduce <condition>joint pain</condition> and <condition>stiffness</condition> linked to aromatase inhibitors in <eligibility>women with early breast cancer</eligibility>: results of a pilot observational study. To determine the possible effect of two homeopathic medicines, Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH, in the prevention of aromatase inhibitor (AI) associated joint pain and/or stiffness in <eligibility>women with early, hormone-receptor positive, breast cancer</eligibility>. This prospective, unrandomized observational study was carried out <duration>between April and October 2014</duration>. Women were recruited in two groups, according to which of the two study centres they attended: one receiving homeopathy in addition to standard treatment (group H) and a control group, receiving <control>standard treatment</control> (group C). All women were treated with an AI. In addition, women in group H also took Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH (5 granules, twice a day) up to 7 days before starting AI treatment. The homeopathic medicines were continued for 3 months. Demographic and clinical data were recorded using a self-assessment questionnaire at inclusion (T0) and 3 months (T3). Primary evaluation criteria were the <outcome-Measure>evolution of scores for joint pain and stiffness</outcome-Measure>, the <outcome-Measure>impact of pain on sleep and analgesic consumption</outcome-Measure> in the two groups after 3 months of treatment. <No-of-participants>Forty</No-of-participants> patients (mean age <average-age>64.9±8.1 years</average-age>) were recruited, <intervention-participants>20</intervention-participant<control-participants>s></control-participants> in each group. Two-thirds of the patients had joint pain before starting AI treatment. There was a significant difference in the <outcome>evolution of mean composite pain score</outcome> between T0 and T3 in the two groups (-1.3 in group H vs. +3.4 in group C; p=0.0001). The <outcome>individual components of the pain score</outcome> (frequency, intensity and number of sites of pain) also decreased significantly in group H. <control-value>Nine</control-value> patients in group C (<control-value>45%</control-value>) vs. <intervention-value>1</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>5%</intervention-value>) in group H increased their <outcome>analgesic consumption</outcome> between T0 and T3 (p=0.0076). After 3 months of treatment, <outcome>joint pain had a worse impact on sleep</outcome> in patients in group C (<control-value>35%</control-value> vs. <intervention-value>0%</intervention-value> of patients; p=0.0083). The <outcome>differences observed in the evolution of morning and daytime stiffness</outcome> between the two groups were smaller (p=0.053 and p=0.33, respectively), with the exception of time necessary for the disappearance of morning stiffness which was greater in group C (37.7±23.0 vs. 17.9±20.1 min; p=0.0173). These preliminary results suggest that treatment with Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH may decrease joint pain/stiffness in breast cancer patients treated with AIs. A larger-scale randomized study is required to confirm these results.
