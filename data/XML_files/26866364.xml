<intervention>Carvedilol</intervention> Administration Can Prevent <condition>Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity</condition>: A Double-Blind Randomized Trial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the preventive effects of carvedilol on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. In this trial, <No-of-participants>70</No-of-participants> <eligibility>female patients with breast cancer who were candidates to receive doxorubicin</eligibility> were enrolled, from which <intervention-participants>30</intervention-participants> were selected randomly to receive carvedilol 6.25 mg daily during chemotherapy, with the rest receiving <control>placebo</control> as the control group. Both groups were evaluated 1 week before and 1 week after chemotherapy by measuring the <outcome-Measure>left ventricular ejection fraction</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>strain/strain rate</outcome-Measure>. Data analysis showed that the case group presented no significant <outcome>reduction in strain and strain-rate parameters</outcome> after intervention, while there was a significant reduction in these parameters in the control group (all p values &lt;.001). Also, the <outcome>mean differences of strain parameters</outcome> in the case group were significantly less than in the control group in all evaluated <outcome>heart walls</outcome> (basal septal strain, p = 0.005, basal lateral strain, p = 0.001, basal inferior strain, p &lt; 0.001, and basal anterior strain, p &lt; 0.001); the same was true for the <outcome>strain-rate parameters</outcome> (the p values for basal septal, basal lateral, basal inferior and basal anterior strain rate were 0.037, 0.037, 0.002 and &lt;.001, respectively). This study shows that carvedilol can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Whether this prophylaxis should be considered as the preferred method needs further investigation.
