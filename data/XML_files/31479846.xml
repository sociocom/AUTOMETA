Effect of <intervention>yoga exercise</intervention> on the quality of life and upper extremity volume among women with breast cancer related <condition>lymphedema</condition>: A pilot study. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of an 8-weeks-yoga intervention on quality of life and upper extremity edema volume in women with breast cancer related lymphedema. This was a controlled trial with pre-post design. A total of <No-of-participants>40</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with breast cancer related lymphedema</eligibility> were randomly assigned into an intervention or <control>control groups</control>. The intervention group participated in a yoga exercise class for <duration>8 weeks</duration>, in a twice a week instructor-led practice and once a week home practice. Outcomes were <outcome-Measure>EORTC QLQ_C30 to measure quality of life, and water displacement volume-meter to measure upper extremity edema volume</outcome-Measure>. The outcomes were evaluated at baseline, 4th and 8th week. Data were analyzed using SPSS. Four weeks after the intervention, a significant difference was observed between the groups with respect to <outcome>role functioning of quality of life</outcome> (P = 0.03). Eight weeks after the intervention, a significant difference was observed between groups concerning <outcome>physical and emotional functioning of quality of life</outcome> (P &lt;0.05). The <outcome>changing trend in physical, role, emotional, and cognitive functioning</outcome> had increased, and in some scales such as <outcome>fatigue, pain, insomnia, and financial difficulties</outcome> the scores were reduced in the intervention group. Regarding edema volume, no significant difference was found between both groups on the 4th and 8th week after the intervention (P > 0.05). As yoga exercise might improve physical, role, and emotional functioning of quality of life as well as reduce fatigue, pain, and insomnia, using this intervention can be suggested amongst women with breast cancer related lymphedema.
