Randomized Trial of <intervention>Lisinopril</intervention> Versus <intervention>Carvedilol</intervention> to Prevent <condition>Trastuzumab Cardiotoxicity</condition> in Patients With Breast Cancer. Trastuzumab is highly effective for human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer but is associated with a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers reduce the rate of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (left ventricular ejection fraction decrease >10%, or >5% if below 50%) and limit treatment interruptions. In this double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, cardiotoxicity and treatment interruptions in <eligibility>patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab for 12 months</eligibility> were evaluated over a <duration>2-year</duration> period. Patients were stratified by anthracycline use and then randomized to receive lisinopril, carvedilol, or <control>placebo</control>. The study included <No-of-participants>468</No-of-participants> women, age <average-age>51 ± 10.7 years</average-age>. For the entire cohort, <outcome>cardiotoxicity</outcome> was comparable in the 3 arms and occurred in <control-value>32%</control-value> of patients on placebo, <intervention-value>29%</intervention-value> on carvedilol, and <intervention-value>30%</intervention-value> on lisinopril. For patients receiving anthracyclines, the <outcome>event rates</outcome> were higher in the placebo group (<intervention-value>47%</intervention-value>) than in the lisinopril (<control-value>37%</control-value>) and the carvedilol (<control-value>31%</control-value>) groups. <outcome>Cardiotoxicity-free survival</outcome> was longer on both carvedilol (hazard ratio: 0.49; 95% confidence interval: 0.27 to 0.89; p = 0.009) and lisinopril (hazard ratio: 0.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.30 to 0.94; p = 0.015) than on placebo. In the whole cohort, as well as in the anthracycline arm, patients on active therapy with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or beta-blockers experienced fewer interruptions in trastuzumab than those on placebo. In patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab, both lisinopril and carvedilol prevented cardiotoxicity in patients receiving anthracyclines. For such patients, lisinopril or carvedilol should be considered to minimize interruptions of trastuzumab.
