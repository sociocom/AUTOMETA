Effect of <intervention>Aerobic and Resistance Exercise</intervention> Intervention on <condition>Cardiovascular Disease Risk</condition> in <eligibility>Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer</eligibility>: A Randomized Clinical Trial. The Framingham Risk Score (FRS) is a valid method for predicting the 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Higher FRS is reported in patients with early-stage breast cancer who are overweight than in healthy, age-matched women, but whether exercise reduces FRS in this patient population is unclear. To examine the effects of a <eligibility>16-week</eligibility> aerobic and resistance exercise intervention on the FRS in women with early-stage breast cancer and with overweight condition or obesity. This single-center, prospective randomized clinical trial included <No-of-participants>100</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with stage I to III breast cancer who were sedentary, with overweight condition or obesity (body mass index of ≥25.0 or body fat of ≥30%), and completed cancer treatment within 6 months prior to enrollment</eligibility>. Participants were randomized to either the <control>usual care</control> or exercise group. <outcome-Measure>Differences in mean changes for outcomes</outcome-Measure> were evaluated using mixed-model repeated-measures analyses. Data were collected <duration>from August 1, 2012, through July 1, 2017</duration>. Data analysis, which followed the intention-to-treat approach, was performed from May 24 to October 2, 2018. The exercise group underwent supervised aerobic and resistance exercise sessions thrice weekly for 16 weeks. The <outcome-Measure>FRS</outcome-Measure> was calculated for each participant using preset points for each of the 6 FRS categories: age, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes presence, and smoking status. In total, <No-of-participants>100</No-of-participants> women were randomized to either the exercise group (n =<intervention-participants> 50</intervention-participants>) or usual care group (n = <control-participants>50</control-participants>). Of these women, 55 (55%) were of <ethinicity>Hispanic white</ethinicity> race/ethnicity and the mean (SD) age was <average-age>53.5 (10.4) years</average-age>. The <outcome>mean (SD) total FRS scores</outcome> postintervention were 2.0 (1.5) in the exercise group and 13.0 (3.0) in the usual care group. The <outcome>postintervention FRS</outcome> was significantly reduced in the exercise group compared with the usual care group (mean, -9.5; 95% CI, -13.0 to -6.0), which corresponds to an 11% (95% CI, -15.0 to -5.0) decrease on the FRS-predicted 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. A 16-week supervised aerobic and resistance exercise intervention appeared to reduce the FRS-predicted 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in women with early-stage breast cancer with overweight condition or obesity.
