Randomized sham-controlled pilot trial of weekly <intervention>electro-acupuncture</intervention> for the prevention of <condition>taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy</condition> in <eligibility>women with early stage breast cancer</eligibility>. To investigate the effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) as a non-pharmacological intervention to prevent or reduce chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy of taxane. <eligibility>Women with stage I-III breast cancer scheduled to receive taxane therapy</eligibility> were randomized to receive a <control>standardized protocol of 12 true</control> or sham EA (SEA) weekly treatments concurrent with taxane treatment. Subjects completed the <outcome-Measure>Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane neurotoxicity subscale (FACT-NTX)</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>other assessments</outcome-Measure> at baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 16. A total of <No-of-participants>180</No-of-participants> subjects were screened, <No-of-participants>63</No-of-participants> enrolled and <No-of-participants>48</No-of-participants> completed week 16 assessments. <average-age>Mean age was 50</average-age> with 25 % <ethinicity>white</ethinicity>, 25 % <ethinicity>black</ethinicity>, and 43 % <ethinicity>Hispanic</ethinicity>; 52 % had no prior chemotherapy. <outcome>At week 12</outcome>, both groups reported an <outcome>increase in mean BPI-SF worst pain score</outcome>, but no mean differences were found between groups (SEA 2.8 vs. EA 2.6, P = .86). By <outcome>week 16</outcome>, the SEA group <outcome>returned to baseline</outcome>, while the EA group <outcome>continued to worsen</outcome> (SEA 1.7 vs. EA 3.4, P = .03). The <outcome>increase in BPI-SF worst pain score</outcome> was 1.62 points higher in the EA group than in the SEA group at week 16 (P = .04). In a randomized, sham-controlled trial of EA for prevention of taxane-induced CIPN, there were no differences in pain or neuropathy between groups at week 12. Of concern, subjects on EA had a slower recovery than SEA subjects. Future studies should focus on EA for treatment as opposed to prevention of CIPN.
