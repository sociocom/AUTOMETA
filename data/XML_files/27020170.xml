Randomized, double-blind study comparing proposed <intervention>biosimilar LA-EP2006</intervention> with <control>reference pegfilgrastim</control> in breast cancer. This randomized, double-blind trial compared proposed biosimilar LA-EP2006 with reference pegfilgrastim in <eligibility>women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer</eligibility> (PROTECT-1). Women (<average-age>≥18 years</average-age>) were randomized to receive LA-EP2006 (n = <intervention-participants>159</intervention-participants>) or reference (n = <control-participants>157</control-participants>) pegfilgrastim (Neulasta(®), Amgen) for ≤6 cycles of (neo)-adjuvant TAC chemotherapy. Primary end point was <outcome-Measure>duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) during cycle 1</outcome-Measure> (number of consecutive days with absolute neutrophil count &lt;.5 × 10(9)/l) with equivalence confirmed if 90% and 95% CIs were within a ±1 day margin. For DSN, LA-EP2006 <outcome>was equivalent to reference</outcome> (difference: 0.07 days; 90% CI: -0.09-0.23; 95% CI: -0.12-0.26). LA-EP2006 and reference pegfilgrastim showed <outcome>no clinically meaningful differences regarding efficacy and safety</outcome> in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
