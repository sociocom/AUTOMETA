A randomised trial of <intervention>weekend and evening breast screening appointments</intervention>. There is a need to research interventions that improve access to and convenience of breast cancer screening services. We conducted a randomised trial comparing invitations to out-of-hours appointments with standard office hour appointments. Women who were to be invited for routine breast screening were randomised (3 : 1 : 1 : 1) to one of these screening invitations: standard office hour appointment, office hour appointment with the option to change to an out-of-hours appointment, weekday evening appointment, or weekend appointment. A total of <No-of-participants>9410</No-of-participants> women were invited to an office hour, <control-participants>3519</control-participants> to an office hour with the option to change, <intervention-participants>3271</intervention-participants> to a weekday evening, and <intervention-participants>3162</intervention-participants> to a weekend appointment. The offer of an initial out-of-hours appointment was associated with a non-significant decrease in <outcome>attendance rates</outcome> (<intervention-value>73.7%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>74.1%</control-value>). The highest <outcome>attendance</outcome> was observed in the group offered an initial office hour appointment with the option to change to out-of-hours (<intervention-value>76.1%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>73.3%</control-value> for standard office hour, P=0.001), with 7% of invitees exercising the option to change. The optimum strategy for improving attendance at breast screening is to offer a traditional office hour appointment and including in the letter of invitation an option to change to an evening or weekend appointment if wished.
