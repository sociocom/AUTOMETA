<condition>Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity</condition> prevention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor <intervention>ramipril</intervention> in <eligibility>women with low-risk breast cancer</eligibility>: results of a prospective randomized study. Anthracycline‑induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) remains the main long‑term irreversible side effect in malignancy survivors. Cardiotoxicity prevention is one of the most reasonable approaches. In this prospective randomized open‑label study, we aimed to verify whether ramipril protects from early‑onset AIC in women with breast cancer (BC). We analyzed data from <No-of-participants>96</No-of-participants> women (median age, <average-age>47 years</average-age>) <eligibility>with BC after breast surgery, without significant cardiovascular diseases, who were eligible for adjuvant anthracyclines</eligibility>. They were randomized to a ramipril or <control>control arm</control>. <outcome-Measure>Cardiotoxicity</outcome-Measure> was estimated with repeat echocardiography and themeasurement of troponin I and N‑terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT‑proBNP) levels over 1‑year follow‑up. Anthracycline‑induced cardiotoxicity was defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), elevated biomarker levels, and/or occurrence of heart failure (HF) or cardiac death. A decrease in <outcome>LVEF above 10‑percent points</outcome> occurred in <intervention-value>6.3%</intervention-value> of ramipril patients and <control-value>18.5%</control-value> ofcontrols (P = 0.15). <outcome>No cases of HF, cardiac death, or LVEF</outcome> decline below 50% were reported. The <outcome>percentage of patients with elevated NT‑proBNP levels</outcome> increased with time in controls (P = 0.003) and remained unchanged in the ramipril arm. At the end of follow‑up, an increase in <outcome>NT‑proBNP levels</outcome> was more common and decline was less common in the control than ramipril arm (P = 0.01). No significant differences in troponin levels were found between the study arms. Ramipril was well tolerated in normotensive women. In relatively young women with BC without serious comorbidities, who received anthracyclines, 1‑year treatment with ramipril exerts potentially protective effects on cardiotoxicity assessed with NT‑proBNP levels.
