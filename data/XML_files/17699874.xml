Comparison of <intervention>ductal lavage</intervention> and <control>random periareolar fine needle aspiration</control> as tissue acquisition methods in early breast cancer prevention trials. Short-term phase I and phase II breast cancer prevention trials require tissue acquisition at baseline and after intervention to evaluate modulation of potential biomarkers. Currently used tissue acquisition methods include ductal lavage (DL), random periareolar fine needle aspiration (RPFNA), and core needle biopsy. The optimum method to retrieve adequate samples and the most accepted method by study participants is not known. We compared RPFNA and DL as breast tissue acquisition methods for short-term breast cancer prevention trials by evaluating sample adequacy and tolerability in subjects who participated in two prospective phase II breast cancer prevention trials. <No-of-participants>Eighty-six</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women at increased risk for breast cancer</eligibility> were included in this study and underwent baseline DL and RPFNA. High risk was defined as having a <outcome-Measure>5-year Gail score of >1.67% or a history of atypical hyperplasia (AH), lobular carcinoma, or breast cancer</outcome-Measure>. Median age was <average-age>54.5 years</average-age> (range, 39-75 years); 75% of the women were postmenopausal. About 51% of the women yielded nipple aspiration fluid, and breast fluid samples via DL were retrieved in 73% of these subjects. Of these samples, 71% were adequate samples (greater than 10 epithelial cells). However, when the entire cohort was considered, only 31% of the subjects had adequate samples. RPFNA was also attempted in all subjects, and sample retrieval rate was 100%. Out of these, 96% of the subjects had adequate samples. In DL samples, <outcome>AH rate</outcome> was <intervention-value>3.7%</intervention-value> was and <outcome>hyperplasia (H) rate</outcome> was <intervention-value>11.1%</intervention-value>. In RPFNA samples, <outcome>AH rate</outcome> was <control-value>12.9%</control-value>, and <outcome>H rate</outcome> was <control-value>24.7%</control-value>. Cytology findings in RPFNA samples correlated with age, menopausal status, and breast cancer risk category (previous history of lobular carcinoma in situ). Both procedures were well tolerated, and no complications occurred among participants. Considering that the main end point for short-term prevention trials is the modulation of biomarkers, it is important to optimize adequate sample acquisition; therefore, RPFNA is a more practical option for future phase I and II breast cancer prevention trials compared with DL.
