<intervention>Hair salon stylists</intervention> as breast cancer prevention lay health advisors for <ethinicity>African American</ethinicity> and <ethinicity>Afro-Caribbean</ethinicity> women.

Pre-intervention surveys were completed by <No-of-participants>1,185</No-of-participants> salon clients. Following program initiation, assessments of <No-of-participants>1,210</No-of-participants> clients were conducted. Among women completing surveys at control salons, <control-value>10%</control-value> reported <outcome>exposure to breast health messages</outcome>, as opposed to <intervention-value>37%</intervention-value> at experimental salons (OR 5.4, 95% CI 3.7-7.9). <outcome>Self-reported exposure</outcome> to stylist-delivered messages was associated with <outcome>improved breast self-examination rates</outcome> (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1) and with greater intentions to have a clinical breast examination (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3).
