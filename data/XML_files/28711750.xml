<intervention>Web-Based Tailored Psychoeducation</intervention> for <eligibility>Breast Cancer Patients at the Onset of the Survivorship Phase</eligibility>: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial. Many breast cancer patients have unmet informational and psychosocial needs after treatment completion. A psychoeducational intervention may be well suited to support these patients. The purpose of this multicenter randomized controlled trial was to examine the effectiveness of a web-based tailored psychoeducational program (ENCOURAGE) for breast cancer patients, which aims to empower patients to take control over prevailing problems. Female breast cancer patients from two hospitals in <location>The Netherlands</location> <eligibility>who recently completed (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy</eligibility> were randomly assigned to <control>standard care</control> or <duration>12-week</duration> access to the ENCOURAGE program providing fully automated information problem-solving strategies, resources, and services for reported problems. At six and 12 weeks, patients completed <outcome-Measure>self-report questions on optimism and control over the future</outcome-Measure> (primary outcome), <outcome-Measure>feelings of being informed</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>acceptance of the illness.</outcome-Measure> At baseline and 12 weeks, distress and quality of life questionnaires were completed. About <No-of-participants>138</No-of-participants> patients were included. Almost all patients (<intervention-value>67</intervention-value> of <intervention-participants>69</intervention-participants>) <outcome>visited ENCOURAGE as requested</outcome>. No differences between the control and intervention group were observed for primary and secondary outcomes. An unplanned subgroup analysis showed that in clinically distressed patients (N = 57 at baseline; 41%), use of the ENCOURAGE program <outcome>increased optimism and control over the future</outcome> at 12 weeks more than in patients in the control group (Cohen's d = 0.65). Although the effectiveness was not demonstrated, a subgroup of women treated for breast cancer can probably be supported by the program. The results of the present study are a starting point for further development and use of the program.
