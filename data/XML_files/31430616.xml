<intervention>Visceral osteopathic manipulative treatment</intervention> reduces patient reported <condition>digestive toxicities</condition> induced by adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: A randomized controlled clinical study. Breast cancer patients often benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, a protocol whose effectiveness is accompanied by disabling adverse effects. The aim of this controlled clinical study was to determine the impact of visceral osteopathy on the incidence of nausea/vomiting, constipation and overall quality of life (QoL) in women operated for breast cancer and undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy in Centre Georges François Leclerc, CGFL. <No-of-participants>Ninety-four</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women operated for a breast cancer stage 1-3, in complete resection and to whom a 3 FEC 100 chemotherapy was prescribed</eligibility>, were randomly allocated to experimental or <control>placebo group</control>. Experimental group underwent a visceral osteopathic technique and placebo group was subjected to a superficial manipulation after each chemotherapy cycle. <outcome-Measure>Rate of grade ≥1 nausea/vomiting or constipation, on the first 3 cycles of FEC 100</outcome-Measure>, were reported. <outcome-Measure>QoL</outcome-Measure> was evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. <outcome>Rate of nausea/vomiting episodes of grade ≥1</outcome> was high in both experimental and placebo group. <outcome>Constipation episodes of grade ≥1</outcome> were also frequent. No significant differences were found between the two groups concerning the <outcome>rate of nausea/vomiting</outcome> (p = 0.569) or <outcome>constipation</outcome> (p = 0.204) according to clinician reported side-effects but patient reported impact of constipation and diarrhoea on <outcome>quality of life</outcome> was significantly lower in experimental group (p = 0.036 and p = 0.038, respectively). Osteopathy does not reduce the incidence of nausea/vomiting in women operated for breast cancer and undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast, patient reported digestive quality of life was significantly ameliorated by osteopathy. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02840890.
