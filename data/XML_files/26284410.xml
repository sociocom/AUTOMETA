[Influence of <intervention>dexamethasone</intervention> on the incidence of <condition>postoperative nausea and vomiting</condition> in <eligibility>breast cancer patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy</eligibility>]. To evaluate the influence of dexamethasone on the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In a prospective trial, <No-of-participants>280</No-of-participants> female (<average-age>18-60 years</average-age>) <eligibility>breast cancer patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy with neoadjuvent chemotherapy</eligibility> were randomized to two groups: one with dexamethasone (Group D) and one <control>without dexamethasone</control> (Group C, n=<control-participants>140</control-participants>). In each group, anesthesia was maintained with volatile anesthesia or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA): TIVA (propofol) without dexamethasone (Subgroup CP); volatile anesthesia (sevoflurane) without dexamethasone (Subgroup CS); TIVA with 10 mg dexamethasone intravenously before anesthetic induction (Subgroup DP); volatile anesthesia with 10 mg dexamethasone intravenously before anesthetic induction (Subgroup DS). A standard general anesthetic technique was used. All the patients received 8 mg of ondansetron intravenously 30 minutes before the end of surgical procedures. The <outcome-Measure>incidence of PONV during the 24-hour postoperative period</outcome-Measure> was recorded. A Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine relevant factors for PONV. The tested factors were: age, body mass index (BMI), duration of surgery, postoperative pain, history of motion sickness/PONV, with or without dexamethasone and anesthetic regimen. There was a significant lower <outcome>incidence of PONV</outcome> in the patients who received dexamethasone than in those who received placebo during the <outcome>24-hour postoperative period</outcome> (<intervention-value>11.4%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>20.7%</control-value>, P=0.034). In the <outcome>early postoperative period (0-2 h)</outcome> dexamethasone reduced the <outcome>incidence of PONV</outcome> ( <intervention-value>1.4%</intervention-value>vs.<control-value>6.4%</control-value>, P=0.031), but in the <outcome>late postoperative period (2-24 h)</outcome> the difference of the incidence was insignificantly (<intervention-value>10.7%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>17.9%</control-value>, P=0.088). No differences were found between <outcome>TIVA and volatile anesthesia</outcome> in the 24-hour postoperative period. Dexamethasone was effective to prevent PONV(OR=0.447, P=0.030), and history of PONV or motion sickness was the risk factor of PONV (OR=15.730, P&lt;.001). Dexamethasone prevents PONV effectively in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and TIVA cannot decrease the incidence of PONV in the 24-hour postoperative period in those patients.
