Nuevo Amanecer: results of a randomized controlled trial of a community-based, peer-delivered <intervention>stress management</intervention> intervention to improve quality of life in <ethinicity>Latinas</ethinicity> with breast cancer. We evaluated a community-based, translational stress management program to improve health-related quality of life in Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer. We adapted a cognitive-behavioral stress management program integrating evidence-based and community best practices to address the needs of Latinas with breast cancer. <eligibility>Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer</eligibility> were randomly assigned to an intervention or <control>usual-care control group</control>. Trained peers delivered the 8-week intervention <duration>between February 2011 and February 2014</duration>. Primary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>breast cancer-specific quality of life and distress</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>general symptoms of distress</outcome-Measure>. Of <No-of-participants>151</No-of-participants> participants, 95% were retained at 6 months (between May 2011 and May 2014). <outcome>Improvements in quality of life from baseline to 6 months</outcome> were greater for the intervention than the control group on physical well-being, emotional well-being, breast cancer concerns, and overall quality of life. Decreases from baseline to 6 months were greater for the intervention group on <outcome>depression and somatization</outcome>. Results suggest that translation of evidence-based programs can reduce psychosocial health disparities in Latinas with breast cancer. Integration of this program into community-based organizations enhances its dissemination potential.
