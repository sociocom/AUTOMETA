Effects of <intervention>music therapy</intervention> on <condition>anxiety</condition> of patients with breast cancer after radical mastectomy: a randomized clinical trial.   This paper is a report of a clinical trial of the effects of music therapy on anxiety of <eligibility>female breast cancer patients following radical mastectomy</eligibility>.   There is insufficient evidence on the effects of music therapy on state anxiety of breast cancer patients following radical mastectomy.   A Hall's Core, Care, and Cure Model-based clinical trial was conducted in <No-of-participants>120</No-of-participants> female breast cancer patients from <duration>March to November 2009</duration>. A randomized controlled design was utilized. The patients were randomly allocated to the experimental group (n = <intervention-participants>60</intervention-participants>) received music therapy in addition to <control>routine nursing care</control>, and the <control>control group</control> (n = <control-participants>60</control-participants>) only received routine nursing care. A standardized questionnaire and the State Anxiety Inventory were applied. The primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>state anxiety score measured at pretest</outcome-Measure> (on the day before radical mastectomy) and <outcome-Measure>at three post-tests</outcome-Measure> (on the day before patients were discharged from hospital, the second and third time of admission to hospital for chemotherapy respectively).   The pretest score revealed that the majority of the patients had a moderate level (77·5%) and 15% had severe level of state anxiety. The repeated-measure ancova model analysis indicated that the <outcome>mean state anxiety score</outcome> was significantly lower in the experimental group than those in the control group at each of the three post-test measurements. The mean difference between the experimental and control group together with 95% confidence intervals were -4·57 (-6·33, -2·82), -8·91 (-10·75, -7·08) and -9·69 (-11·52, -7·85) at the 1st post-test, 2nd post-test and 3rd post-test respectively.   Music therapy is found to have positive effects on decreasing state anxiety score.
