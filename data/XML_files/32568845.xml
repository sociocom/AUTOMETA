Anesthesia and Circulating Tumor Cells in Primary Breast Cancer Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial. The effect of anesthetic drugs on cancer outcomes remains unclear. This trial aimed to assess postoperative circulating tumor cell counts-an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer-to determine how anesthesia may indirectly affect prognosis. It was hypothesized that patients receiving sevoflurane would have higher postoperative tumor cell counts. The parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted in two centers in <location>Switzerland</location>. Patients aged <average-age>18 to 85 yr</average-age> <eligibility>without metastases and scheduled for primary breast cancer surgery</eligibility> were eligible. The patients were randomly assigned to either <intervention>sevoflurane</intervention> or <control>propofol anesthesia</control>. The patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>circulating tumor cell counts over time</outcome-Measure>, assessed at three time points postoperatively (0, 48, and 72 h) by the CellSearch assay. Secondary outcomes included <outcome-Measure>maximal circulating tumor cells value, positivity (cutoff: at least 1 and at least 5 tumor cells/7.5 ml blood), and the association between natural killer cell activity and tumor cell counts</outcome-Measure>. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02005770). <duration>Between March 2014 and April 2018</duration>, <No-of-participants>210</No-of-participants> participants were enrolled, assigned to sevoflurane (n = <intervention-participants>107</intervention-participants>) or propofol (n = <control-participants>103</control-participants>) anesthesia, and eventually included in the analysis. Anesthesia type did not affect <outcome>circulating tumor cell counts over time</outcome> (median circulating tumor cell count [interquartile range]; for propofol: 1 [0 to 4] at 0 h, 1 [0 to 2] at 48 h, and 0 [0 to 1] at 72 h; and for sevoflurane: 1 [0 to 4] at 0 h, 0 [0 to 2] at 48 h, and 1 [0 to 2] at 72 h; rate ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.95 to 1.71]; P = 0.103) or positivity. In one secondary analysis, administrating sevoflurane led to a significant increase in <outcome>maximal tumor cell counts</outcome> postoperatively. There was no association between natural killer cell activity and circulating tumor cell counts. In this randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of anesthesia on an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer, there was no difference between sevoflurane and propofol with respect to circulating tumor cell counts over time.
