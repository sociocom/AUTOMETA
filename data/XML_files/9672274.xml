Interim analysis of the incidence of breast cancer in the Royal Marsden Hospital <intervention>tamoxifen</intervention> randomised chemoprevention trial. Tamoxifen, a drug with antioestrogenic effects, is predicted to prevent the occurrence of breast cancer. We have undertaken a trial of tamoxifen in healthy women who are at increased risk of breast cancer because of family history. We report a planned interim analysis. <duration>Between October, 1986, and April, 1996</duration>, we accrued <No-of-participants>2494</No-of-participants> healthy women aged <average-age>between 30 and 70</average-age> <eligibility>with a family history of breast cancer</eligibility>. They have been randomised (double blind) to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day orally or <control>placebo</control> for up to <duration>8 years</duration>. Follow-up included clinical assessment, annual mammography, and assessment of toxicity and compliance. The primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>occurrence of breast cancer</outcome-Measure>, which was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with a survival curve. With a median follow-up of 70 months, <No-of-participants>2471</No-of-participants> women (tamoxifen <intervention-participants>1238</intervention-participants>, placebo <control-participants>1233</control-participants>) were suitable for analysis. The groups were evenly matched at baseline, and compliance was good. The <outcome>overall frequency of breast cancer</outcome> is the same for women on tamoxifen or placebo (tamoxifen <intervention-value>34</intervention-value>, placebo <control-value>36</control-value>, relative risk 1.06 [95% CI 0.7-1.7], p=0.8). Participants who were already on hormone-replacement therapy when they entered the study had an increased risk of breast cancer compared with non-users. Those participants who started such therapy while on trial had a significantly reduced risk. The <outcome>safety profile</outcome> of tamoxifen was as expected. We have been unable to show any effect of tamoxifen on breast-cancer incidence in healthy women, contrary to the report from the NSABP-P1 study showing a 45% reduction in healthy women given tamoxifen versus placebo. Differences in the study populations for the two trials may underlie these conflicting findings: eligibility in our trial was based predominantly on a strong family history of breast cancer whereas in the NSABP trial was mostly based on non-genetic risk factors. The importance of oestrogen promotion may vary between such populations.
