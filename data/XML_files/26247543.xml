Acute and Short-term Toxic Effects of <control>Conventionally Fractionated</control> vs <intervention>Hypofractionated Whole-Breast Irradiation</intervention>: A Randomized Clinical Trial. The most appropriate dose fractionation for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) remains uncertain. To assess acute and 6-month toxic effects and quality of life (QOL) with conventionally fractionated WBI (CF-WBI) vs hypofractionated WBI (HF-WBI). Unblinded randomized trial of CF-WBI (n = <control-participants>149</control-participants>; 50.00 Gy/25 fractions + boost [10.00-14.00 Gy/5-7 fractions]) vs HF-WBI (n = <intervention-participants>138</intervention-participants>; 42.56 Gy/16 fractions + boost [10.00-12.50 Gy/4-5 fractions]) following breast-conserving surgery administered in community-based and academic cancer centers to 287 women <average-age>40 years or older</average-age> <eligibility>with stage 0 to II breast cancer for whom WBI without addition of a third field was recommended</eligibility>; 76% of study participants (n = 217) were overweight or obese. Patients were enrolled <duration>from February 2011 through February 2014</duration> and observed for a minimum of 6 months. Administration of CF-WBI or HF-WBI. Physician-reported <outcome-Measure>acute and 6-month toxic effects</outcome-Measure> using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, and <outcome-Measure>patient-reported QOL</outcome-Measure> using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Patients with Breast Cancer (FACT-B). All analyses were intention to treat, with outcomes compared using the χ2 test, Cochran-Armitage test, and ordinal logistic regression. Of <No-of-participants>287</No-of-participants> participants, <control-participants>149</control-participants> were randomized to CF-WBI and <intervention-participants>138</intervention-participants> to HF-WBI. Treatment arms were well matched for baseline characteristics, including FACT-B total score (HF-WBI, 120.1 vs CF-WBI, 118.8; P = .46) and individual QOL items such as somewhat or more lack of energy (HF-WBI, 38% vs CF-WBI, 39%; P = .86) and somewhat or more trouble meeting family needs (HF-WBI, 10% vs CF-WBI, 14%; P = .54). Maximum <outcome>physician-reported acute dermatitis</outcome> (<intervention-value>36%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>69%</control-value>; P &lt;.001), <outcome>pruritus</outcome> (<intervention-value>54%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>81%</control-value>; P &lt;.001), <outcome>breast pain</outcome> (<intervention-value>55%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>74%</control-value>; P = .001), <outcome>hyperpigmentation</outcome> (<intervention-value>9%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>20%</control-value>; P = .002), and <outcome>fatigue</outcome> (<intervention-value>9%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>17%</control-value>; P = .02) during irradiation were lower in patients randomized to HF-WBI. The rate of overall <outcome>grade 2 or higher acute toxic effects</outcome> was less with HF-WBI than with CF-WBI (<intervention-value>47%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>78%</control-value>; P &lt;.001). Six months after irradiation, physicians reported less <outcome>fatigue</outcome> in patients randomized to HF-WBI (<intervention-value>0%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>6%</control-value>; P = .01), and patients randomized to HF-WBI reported less <outcome>lack of energy</outcome> (<intervention-value>23%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>39%</control-value>; P &lt;.001) and less <outcome>trouble meeting family needs</outcome> (<intervention-value>3%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>9%</control-value>; P = .01). Multivariable regression confirmed the superiority of HF-WBI in terms of patient-reported lack of energy (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.24-0.63) and trouble meeting family needs (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.75). Treatment with HF-WBI appears to yield lower rates of acute toxic effects than CF-WBI as well as less fatigue and less trouble meeting family needs 6 months after completing radiation therapy. These findings should be communicated to patients as part of shared decision making. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01266642.
