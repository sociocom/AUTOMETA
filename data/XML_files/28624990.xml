Nutrition Literacy among Cancer Survivors: Feasibility Results from the Healthy Eating and Living Against Breast Cancer (HEAL-BCa) Study: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial. Knowledge of nutrition among breast cancer patients is insufficient, despite their motivation to seek valid information about healthy food choices. This study examines the feasibility of <intervention>nutrition education</intervention> workshops for cancer survivors, to inform the design of a multi-center intervention. <No-of-participants>Fifty-nine</No-of-participants> <eligibility>female English-speaking breast cancer patients, who had completed treatment</eligibility>, were enrolled. Participants were randomized to the intervention or <control>control group</control>. The intervention group attended six nutrition education sessions, and the control group received brochures. Measurements were done at baseline and <duration>3-month</duration> follow-up and included the <outcome-Measure>Assessment Instrument for Breast Cancer (NLit-BCa)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>fruit/vegetable</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>general health literacy screeners</outcome-Measure>. Height and weight were measured. <outcome-Measure>Changes in nutrition literacy</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>health literacy</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>food intake</outcome-Measure> from baseline to follow-up (within-group change) were calculated for both groups (effect sizes were reported as Cohen's d). Participants were mostly <ethinicity>white</ethinicity>, with a mean age of <average-age>58 years</average-age>, BMI of 31.6 kg/m2, and had college degrees. <outcome>Follow-up rates</outcome> were high (<control-value>89%</control-value> = control and <intervention-value>77%</intervention-value> = intervention group). At baseline, participants scored high for most NLit-BCa assessment components except food portions in both groups. At the 3-month follow-up, <outcome>effect sizes (d) on the NLit-BCa</outcome> ranged from -0.5 to 0.16. The study met its recruitment goals within 6 months. Focus groups indicated that (a) attending six sessions was acceptable, (b) patients found social/emotional support, (c) improvements should include information for special diets and booster sessions. This pilot study suggests that the intervention was acceptable and that scaling up of this intervention is feasible and could provide benefit to breast cancer survivors.
