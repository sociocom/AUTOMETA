Phase III placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial of <intervention>pegfilgrastim</intervention> to reduce the risk of <condition>febrile neutropenia</condition> in <eligibility>breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy</eligibility>. Pegfilgrastim is a pegylated form of filgrastim, a recombinant protein of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, that is used to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia (FN). Here, we report the results of a phase III trial of pegfilgrastim in breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to determine the efficacy of pegfilgrastim in reducing the risk of FN in early-stage breast cancer patients. A total of <No-of-participants>351</No-of-participants> women (<intervention-participants>177</intervention-participants> in the pegfilgrastim group and <control-participants>174</control-participants> in the <control>placebo</control> group) <average-age>between 20 and 69 years</average-age> of age with stage I-III invasive breast carcinoma who were to receive TC chemotherapy (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks) as either neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy were enrolled; <No-of-participants>346</No-of-participants> of these patients were treated with either pegfilgrastim (n = <intervention-participants>173</intervention-participants>) or placebo (n = <control-participants>173</control-participants>). The <outcome>incidence of FN</outcome> was significantly lower in the pegfilgrastim group than in the placebo group (<intervention-value>1.2</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>68.8 %</control-value>, respectively; P &lt;0.001). In addition, patients in the pegfilgrastim group required less <outcome>hospitalization and antibiotics for FN</outcome>. Most <outcome>adverse events</outcome> were consistent with those expected for breast cancer subjects receiving TC chemotherapy. Pegfilgrastim is safe and significantly reduces the incidence of FN in breast cancer patients.
