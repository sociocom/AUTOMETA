Alberta <intervention>physical activity</intervention> and breast cancer prevention trial: sex hormone changes in a year-long exercise intervention among postmenopausal women. We examined how an aerobic exercise intervention influenced circulating estradiol, estrone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), androstenedione, and testosterone levels, which may be involved in the association between physical activity and breast cancer risk. A two-center, two-arm randomized controlled trial of exercise was conducted in <No-of-participants>320</No-of-participants> <eligibility>postmenopausal, sedentary women</eligibility> age <average-age>50 to 74 years</average-age>. Participants were randomly assigned to a 1-year <intervention>aerobic exercise</intervention> intervention of 225 min/wk (n = <intervention-participants>160</intervention-participants>) or to a control group who maintained their <control>usual level of activity</control> (n = <control-participants>160</control-participants>). Baseline, 6-month, and 12-month assessments of estrone, estradiol, androstenedione, and testosterone were quantified by radioimmunoassay after extraction, and SHBG was quantified by an immunometric assay. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed using linear mixed models. Blood data were available on <No-of-participants>309</No-of-participants> women (96.6%) at 12 months. Women in the intervention group exercised an average of 3.6 d/wk for 178 min/wk. At 12 months, statistically <outcome>significant reductions in estradiol</outcome> (treatment effect ratio [TER] = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.98) and <outcome>free estradiol</outcome> (TER = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.96) and <outcome>increases in SHBG</outcome> (TER = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.07) were observed in the exercise group compared with the control group. <outcome>No significant differences in estrone, androstenedione, and testosterone levels</outcome> were observed between exercisers and controls at 12 months. This trial found that previously sedentary postmenopausal women can adhere to a moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise program that results in changes in estradiol and SHBG concentrations that are consistent with a lower risk for postmenopausal breast cancer.
