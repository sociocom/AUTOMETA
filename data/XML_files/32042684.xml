A clinical study on the use of <intervention>Huaier granules</intervention> in post-surgical treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been developing rapidly in cancer treatment. Huaier is a widely used fungus by TCM to treat different kinds of cancers. Its good efficacy in prevention of tumor recurrence and metastasis has been proven by a large number of clinical studies. In order to further investigate the efficacy and safety of Huaier granules in post-surgical therapy for stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, we performed a case-control clinical study to observe its effects on the post-surgical safety and survival rates of these patients. <No-of-participants>Two hundred and one</No-of-participants> <eligibility>TNBC patients underwent modified radical mastectomy</eligibility> were selected, they were admitted to our hospital <duration>between October 2010 to September 2014</duration>. The patients were randomly allocated to the experimental group (<intervention-participants>101</intervention-participants> cases) or the <control>control group</control> (<control-participants>100</control-participants> cases). Patients in the experimental group were treated with Huaier granules, by orally taking 20 g each time with 3 times a day. Medication was started during chemotherapy or at the time in 6 or 18 months after it. The control group did not receive any TCM preparations during this process. The <outcome-Measure>disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)</outcome-Measure> were measured as the main outcome. The median follow-up time was 46 months. For the <control-participants>100</control-participants> patients in control group, <outcome>5-year DFS</outcome> and <outcome>OS</outcome> was <control-value>82%</control-value> and <control-value>86%</control-value> respectively, while <intervention-value>87.1%</intervention-value> and <intervention-value>90.1%</intervention-value> for the <intervention-participants>101</intervention-participants> patients in the experimental group. The difference was not statistically significant. However, <outcome>stage III patients</outcome> in the control group showed a <outcome>5-year DFS</outcome> of <control-value>53.8%</control-value> and <outcome>OS</outcome> of <control-value>65.4%</control-value>, which were significantly lower than that of stage III patients in the experimental group as <intervention-value>81.3%</intervention-value> and <intervention-value>87.5%</intervention-value>. In the experimental group, <intervention-value>10</intervention-value> patients with 6-month medication showed <outcome>disease progression</outcome>, whereas only <control-value>3</control-value> patients with 18-month medication showed disease progression. This difference was statistically significant as well. Huaier granules could play an important role in post-surgical adjuvant therapy of TNBC patients, specially by effectively increasing the DFS and OS of breast cancer patients at middle to advanced stage.
