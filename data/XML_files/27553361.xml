<intervention>Entertainment-Education Narrative</intervention> Versus <intervention>Nonnarrative Interventions</intervention> to Educate and Motivate <ethinicity>Latinas</ethinicity> to Engage in Mammography Screening. The evidence is limited comparing the effects of entertainment-education (E-E) narrative versus nonnarrative interventions to educate and motivate Latinas to engage in mammography screening. This study compared an E-E narrative intervention to two nonnarrative interventions' effects among Latinas on breast cancer knowledge and motivation, as measured by <outcome-Measure>changes in self-efficacy</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>behavioral norms</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>behavioral intentions to engage in mammography screening</outcome-Measure>. A sample of <No-of-participants>141</No-of-participants> <eligibility>Spanish-speaking Latinas</eligibility> was randomly assigned to one of three arms: an E-E narrative video, a nonnarrative educational video, and <control>printed educational materials</control>. Using a repeated measures design, the <outcome-Measure>influence of the E-E narrative on pretest to posttest measures</outcome-Measure> was assessed and compared to the influence of the other two interventions. The E-E narrative and nonnarrative interventions significantly <outcome>increased Latinas' breast cancer knowledge, mammography self-efficacy, and behavioral norms from pretest to posttest</outcome>. However, the E-E narrative participants' <outcome>pretest to posttest difference in mammography self-efficacy was significantly higher</outcome> when compared to the difference of the other two interventions. The effect of the E-E narrative intervention on <outcome>self-efficacy and behavioral norms</outcome> was moderated by the participants' absorption in the story and identification with the story characters. E-E narrative and nonnarrative interventions significantly educated and motivated Latinas to engage in mammography screening. The effects on mammography self-efficacy, an important precursor to behavior change, can be more strongly influenced by E-E narratives. Although E-E narrative and nonnarrative interventions were effective, the need still exists to assess if they can ultimately influence lifesaving breast cancer screening behaviors.
