A Randomized Multicenter Phase II Study of <intervention>Docosahexaenoic Acid</intervention> in <eligibility>Patients with a History of Breast Cancer, Premalignant Lesions, or Benign Breast Disease</eligibility>. Obesity, a cause of subclinical inflammation, is a risk factor for the development of postmenopausal breast cancer and is associated with poorer cancer outcomes. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, possesses anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that treatment with DHA would reduce the expression of proinflammatory genes and aromatase, the rate-limiting enzyme for estrogen biosynthesis, in benign breast tissue of overweight/obese women. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II study of DHA given for <duration>12 weeks</duration> to <eligibility>overweight/obese women with a history of stage I-III breast cancer, DCIS/LCIS, Paget's disease, or proliferative benign breast disease</eligibility> was carried out. In this placebo controlled trial, the primary objective was to <outcome-Measure>determine whether DHA (1,000 mg by mouth twice daily) reduced breast tissue levels of TNFα</outcome-Measure>. Secondary objectives included <outcome-Measure>evaluation of the effect of DHA on breast tissue levels of COX-2, IL1β, aromatase, white adipose tissue inflammation, and gene expression by RNA-seq</outcome-Measure>. <outcome-Measure>Red blood cell fatty acid levels</outcome-Measure> were measured to assess compliance. <duration>From July 2013 to November 2015</duration>, <No-of-participants>64</No-of-participants> participants were randomized and treated on trial (<intervention-participants>32</intervention-participant<control-participants>s></control-participants> women per arm). <outcome>Increased levels of omega-3 fatty acids in red blood cells</outcome> were detected following treatment with DHA (P &lt;0.001) but not placebo. Treatment with DHA did not alter <outcome>levels of TNFα (P = 0.71), or other biomarkers</outcome> including the transcriptome in breast samples. Treatment with DHA was <outcome>overall well-tolerated</outcome>. Although compliance was confirmed, we did not observe changes in the levels of prespecified biomarkers in the breast after treatment with DHA when compared with placebo.
