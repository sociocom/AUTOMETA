Prevention of <condition>lymphedema</condition> via <intervention>axillary reverse mapping</intervention> for arm lymph-node preservation following breast cancer surgery: a randomized controlled trial. Breast cancer, with an incidence of 32%, is the most frequent cancer among <ethinicity>Egyptian</ethinicity> women. The frequency of arm lymphedema after axillary surgery for breast cancer ranges from 7 to 77%. Axillary reverse mapping is a technique aimed to distinguish and conserve upper-limb lymphatics and lymph nodes during the course of axillary surgery and could help to prevent arm lymphedema. Patients (n = <No-of-participants>48</No-of-participants>) were prepared for axillary lymph-node dissection. The study group and the <control>control group</control> each contained <intervention-participants>24</intervention-participant<control-participants>s></control-participants> individuals. In the study group, following dye injection, stained arm lymph nodes and lymphatics were conserved during axillary dissection, whereas control-group participants underwent the conventional procedure. All participants were re-evaluated after <duration>6 months</duration>, and the <outcome-Measure>incidence of lymphedema</outcome-Measure> was recorded by measuring arm circumference at a level 10 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle. Arm lymphedema was defined as a change in the circumference of the ipsilateral upper extremity > 2 cm during the follow-up period. Age, tumor size and N stage were not significantly different between the study and control groups. <outcome>Lymph-node visualization</outcome> was achieved in <intervention-value>20</intervention-value> participants (<intervention-value>83.3%</intervention-value>) in the study group. <outcome>Suspicious stained lymph nodes</outcome> were surgically removed from four individuals but showed no metastatic involvement. In <intervention-value>20</intervention-value> individuals in the study group, <outcome>no stained lymph nodes were removed</outcome>. The <outcome>incidence of lymphedema</outcome> in the control group was <control-value>16.7%</control-value>, and the incidence in the study group was <intervention-value>4.2%</intervention-value>. Axillary reverse mapping is a minimally invasive technique that can be performed during axillary lymph-node dissection, helping to prevent the subsequent development of arm lymphedema. #SCURCTN3276, retrospectively registered on 11 April 2017 at Research Ethics Committee at the Faculty of medicine-Suez Canal University.
