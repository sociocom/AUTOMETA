<intervention>Educational</intervention> intervention on breast cancer early detection: effectiveness among target group women in the district of <location>Gampaha, Sri Lanka</location>. The present study concerns the effectiveness of an educational intervention for improving knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of breast cancer early detection among target group women (TGW) in the district of Gampaha, Sri Lanka. The study was a community-based intervention. Two medical officer of health areas in Gampaha district were selected using random sampling as intervention (IA) and <control>control</control> (CA). Public health midwives (PHMs) in the IA were exposed to the educational intervention first, conducted the same among the TGW through PHMs. KAP was assessed using an interviewer- administrated questionnaire among <No-of-participants>260</No-of-participants> TGW from each area selected using cluster sampling before and six months after the intervention. The <outcome>overall median scores for KAP</outcome> among TGW in IG increased significantly from <outcome>pre intervention level</outcome> of <intervention-value>54%</intervention-value> (IQR: 46-59%), <intervention-value>50%</intervention-value> (IQR: 41-59%), and <intervention-value>0%</intervention-value> (IQR: 0-20%) to <outcome>post intervention level</outcome> of <intervention-value>77%</intervention-value> (IQR: 72-82%), <intervention-value>68%</intervention-value> (IQR: 59- 76 %) and <intervention-value>40%</intervention-value> (IQR: 20-60%) respectively. In CG, <outcome>overall median scores for KAP</outcome> remained almost the same <outcome>at pre intervention</outcome> <control-value>54%</control-value> (IQR:44-59%), <control-value>50%</control-value> (IQR:36-59%) and <control-value>0%</control-value> (IQR: 0-20%) and <outcome>post intervention</outcome> <control-value>54%</control-value> (IQR:46-59%), <control-value>50%</control-value> (IQR:36-64%) and <control-value>0%</control-value> (IQR: 0-20%) respectively. The educational intervention was found to be effective.
