Perceived stress moderates the effects of a randomized trial of <intervention>dance movement therapy</intervention> on <condition>diurnal cortisol slopes</condition> in breast cancer patients. Women with breast cancer are at risk of psychosocial distress and may suffer from aberrant diurnal cortisol rhythms. Dance movement therapy (DMT), a movement-based psychotherapy that incorporates exercise and artistic components, has demonstrated stress reduction effects. This study examined the effects of DMT on the diurnal cortisol rhythms of <eligibility>breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment</eligibility> and the role of perceived stress in producing such effects. The study sample comprised <No-of-participants>121</No-of-participants> <ethinicity>Chinese</ethinicity> breast cancer patients randomized to the DMT (n=<intervention-participants>63</intervention-participants>) and <control>control</control> (n=<control-participants>58</control-participants>) groups. The intervention consisted of six 1.5-h group sessions held twice weekly over the course of radiotherapy. Participants completed validated self-report measures of <outcome-Measure>perceived stress</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>fatigue</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>pain</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>sleep disturbance</outcome-Measure> and provided five <outcome-Measure>salivary cortisol samples at baseline (Time 1) and post-intervention (Time 2)</outcome-Measure>. Moderated mediation analysis was used to evaluate the intervention effect on Time 2 diurnal cortisol slopes. Despite the absence of a significant DMT <outcome>effect on diurnal cortisol slopes</outcome> (B=-0.55, 95% CI=-1.20 to 0.08, β=-0.14), baseline <outcome>perceived stress</outcome> significantly moderated the intervention effect (B=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.32 to -0.05, β=-0.30). At high levels of baseline perceived stress (1 SD above the mean), the DMT group showed a steeper cortisol slope (M=-7.14) than the control group (M=-5.80) at Time 2. The present findings suggest that DMT might have a beneficial effect on diurnal cortisol slopes in breast cancer patients with high levels of distress.
