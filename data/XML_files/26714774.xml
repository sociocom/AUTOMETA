Influence of Obesity on Breast Density Reduction by <intervention>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</intervention>: Evidence from a Randomized Clinical Trial. Preclinical data indicate that omega-3 fatty acids (n-3FA) potentiate the chemopreventive effect of the antiestrogen (AE) tamoxifen against mammary carcinogenesis. The role of n-3FA in breast cancer prevention in humans is controversial. Preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that n-3FA may be preferentially protective in obese subjects. To directly test the protective effect of n-3FA against breast cancer, we conducted a <duration>2-year</duration>, open-label randomized clinical trial in <No-of-participants>266</No-of-participants> <eligibility>healthy postmenopausal women (50% normal weight, 30% overweight, 20% obese) with high breast density (BD; â‰¥25%)</eligibility> detected on their routine screening mammograms. Eligible women were randomized to one of the following five groups (i) <control>no treatment, control</control>; (ii) <intervention>raloxifene</intervention> 60 mg; (iii) raloxifene 30 mg; (iv) n-3FA <intervention>lovaza</intervention> 4 g; and (v) lovaza 4 g plus raloxifene 30 mg. The 2-year <outcome-Measure>change in BD</outcome-Measure>, a validated biomarker of breast cancer risk, was the primary endpoint of the study. In subset analysis, we tested the prespecified hypothesis that body mass index (BMI) influences the relationship between plasma n-3FA on BD. While none of the interventions affected BD in the intention-to-treat analysis, <outcome>increase in plasma DHA</outcome> was associated with a <outcome>decrease in absolute breast density</outcome> but only in participants with BMI >29. Our results suggest that obese women may preferentially experience breast cancer risk reduction from n-3FA administration.
