Preventive effect of <intervention>oral magnesium</intervention> in <condition>postmastectomy pain</condition>: protocol for a randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Breast cancer affects 1 in 10 women worldwide, and mastectomy is a cause of chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine, memantine, dextromethorphan or magnesium are used to treat refractory pain by blocking NMDAR. Oral memantine has been shown to prevent postmastectomy pain and cognitive impact and to maintain quality of life. Likewise, the present study is intended to assess the preventive effect of oral magnesium, administered ahead of mastectomy, on the development of neuropathic pain. As a physiological blocker of NMDAR, magnesium could be an interesting candidate to prevent postoperative pain and associated comorbidities, including cognitive and emotional disorders, multiple analgesic consumption and impaired quality of life. A randomised double-blind controlled clinical trial (NCT03063931) will include <No-of-participants>100</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy</eligibility> at the Oncology Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, <location>France</location>. Magnesium (100 mg/day; n=<intervention-participants>50</intervention-participants>) or <control>placebo</control> (n=<control-participants>50</control-participants>) will be administered for <duration>6 weeks</duration>, starting 2 weeks before surgery. <outcome-Measure>Intensity of pain</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>cognitive and emotional function</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>quality of life</outcome-Measure> will be assessed by questionnaires. The primary endpoint is <outcome-Measure>pain intensity on a 0-10 numerical rating scale at 1 month postmastectomy.</outcome-Measure> Data analysis will use mixed models; all tests will be two-tailed, with type-I error set at α=0.05. The study protocol and informed consent form were approved in December 2016 by the French Research Ethics Committee (South East VI Committee). Results will be communicated in various congresses and published in international publications. NCT03063931.
