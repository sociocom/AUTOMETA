Association of Menopausal Hormone Therapy With Breast Cancer Incidence and Mortality During Long-term Follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Clinical Trials. The influence of menopausal hormone therapy on breast cancer remains unsettled with discordant findings from observational studies and randomized clinical trials. To assess the association of prior randomized use of estrogen plus progestin or prior randomized use of estrogen alone with breast cancer incidence and mortality in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trials. Long-term follow-up of 2 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials that involved <No-of-participants>27 347</No-of-participants> <eligibility>postmenopausal women</eligibility> aged <average-age>50 through 79 years</average-age> <eligibility>with no prior breast cancer and negative baseline screening mammogram</eligibility>. Women were enrolled at 40 <location>US</location> centers <duration>from 1993 to 1998</duration> with follow-up through December 31, 2017. In the trial involving <No-of-participants>16 608</No-of-participants> women with a uterus, <intervention-participants>8506</intervention-participants> were randomized to receive 0.625 mg/d of <intervention>conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)</intervention> plus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and <control-participants>8102</control-participants>, <control>placebo</control>. In the trial involving <No-of-participants>10 739</No-of-participants> women with prior hysterectomy, <intervention-participants>5310</intervention-participants> were randomized to receive 0.625 mg/d of CEE alone and <control-participants>5429</control-participants>, placebo. The CEE-plus-MPA trial was stopped in 2002 after 5.6 years' median intervention duration, and the CEE-only trial was stopped in 2004 after 7.2 years' median intervention duration. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>breast cancer incidence</outcome-Measure> (protocol prespecified primary monitoring outcome for harm) and secondary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>deaths from breast cancer and deaths after breast cancer</outcome-Measure>. Among <No-of-participants>27 347</No-of-participants> postmenopausal women who were randomized in both trials (baseline mean [SD] age, <average-age>63.4 years [7.2 years]</average-age>), after more than 20 years of median cumulative follow-up, mortality information was available for more than 98%. CEE alone compared with placebo among <intervention-participants>10 739</intervention-participants> women with a prior hysterectomy was associated with statistically significantly lower <outcome>breast cancer incidence</outcome> with <intervention-value>238</intervention-value> cases (annualized rate, <intervention-value>0.30%</intervention-value>) vs <control-value>296</control-value> cases (annualized rate, <control-value>0.37%</control-value>; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.93; P = .005) and was associated with statistically significantly lower <outcome>breast cancer mortality</outcome> with <intervention-value>30</intervention-value> deaths (annualized mortality rate, <intervention-value>0.031%</intervention-value>) vs <control-value>46</control-value> deaths (annualized mortality rate, <control-value>0.046%</control-value>; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37-0.97; P = .04). In contrast, CEE plus MPA compared with placebo among <control-participants>16 608</control-participants> women with a uterus was associated with statistically significantly higher <outcome>breast cancer incidence</outcome> with <intervention-value>584</intervention-value> cases (annualized rate, <intervention-value>0.45%</intervention-value>) vs <control-value>447</control-value> cases (annualized rate, <control-value>0.36%</control-value>; HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13-1.45; P &lt;.001) and no significant difference in <outcome>breast cancer mortality</outcome> with <intervention-value>71</intervention-value> deaths (annualized mortality rate, <intervention-value>0.045%</intervention-value>) vs <control-value>53</control-value> deaths (annualized mortality rate, <control-value>0.035%</control-value>; HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.94-1.95; P= .11). In this long-term follow-up study of 2 randomized trials, prior randomized use of CEE alone, compared with placebo, among women who had a previous hysterectomy, was significantly associated with lower breast cancer incidence and lower breast cancer mortality, whereas prior randomized use of CEE plus MPA, compared with placebo, among women who had an intact uterus, was significantly associated with a higher breast cancer incidence but no significant difference in breast cancer mortality.
