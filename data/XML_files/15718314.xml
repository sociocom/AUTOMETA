First and subsequent cycle use of <intervention>pegfilgrastim</intervention> prevents <condition>febrile neutropenia</condition> in patients with breast cancer: a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study. We evaluated the efficacy of pegfilgrastim to reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia associated with docetaxel in breast cancer patients. Patients were randomly assigned to either <control>placebo</control> or pegfilgrastim 6 mg subcutaneously on day 2 of each 21-day chemotherapy cycle of 100 mg/m(2) docetaxel. The primary end point was the <outcome-Measure>percentage of patients developing febrile neutropenia</outcome-Measure> (defined as body temperature >/= 38.2 degrees C and neutrophil count &lt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L on the same day of the fever or the day after). Secondary end points were <outcome-Measure>incidence of hospitalizations associated with a diagnosis of febrile neutropenia</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>intravenous (IV) anti-infectives</outcome-Measure> required for febrile neutropenia, and the <outcome-Measure>ability to maintain planned chemotherapy dose on time</outcome-Measure>. Patients with febrile neutropenia were converted to open-label pegfilgrastim in subsequent cycles. <No-of-participants>Nine hundred twenty-eight</No-of-participants> patients received placebo (n = <control-participants>465</control-participants>) or pegfilgrastim (n = <intervention-participants>463</intervention-participants>). Patients receiving pegfilgrastim, compared with patients receiving placebo, had a lower <outcome>incidence of febrile neutropenia</outcome> (<intervention-value>1%</intervention-value> v <control-value>17%</control-value>, respectively; P &lt;.001), <outcome>febrile neutropenia-related hospitalization</outcome> (<intervention-value>1%</intervention-value> v <control-value>14%</control-value>, respectively; P &lt;.001), and <outcome>use of IV anti-infectives</outcome> (<intervention-value>2%</intervention-value> v <control-value>10%</control-value>, respectively; P &lt;.001). The <outcome>percentage of patients receiving the planned dose on time</outcome> was similar between patients receiving pegfilgrastim and patients who initially received placebo (<intervention-value>80%</intervention-value> and <control-value>78%</control-value>, respectively), as would be expected of the study design. Pegfilgrastim was generally well tolerated and safe, and the adverse events reported were typical of this patient population. First and subsequent cycle use of pegfilgrastim with a moderately myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimen markedly reduced febrile neutropenia, febrile neutropenia-related hospitalizations, and IV anti-infective use.
