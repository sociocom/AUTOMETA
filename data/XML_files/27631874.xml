Preventing weight gain in <ethinicity>African American</ethinicity> breast cancer survivors using <intervention>smart scales</intervention> and <intervention>activity trackers</intervention>: a randomized controlled pilot study. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of two <duration>6-month</duration>, self-regulation interventions that focused on daily self-weighing (DSW) and used objective monitoring and tailored feedback about weight (±activity), to prevent weight gain among African American breast cancer survivors. Participants (n = <No-of-participants>35</No-of-participants>) were randomized to an intervention + activity monitoring (INT+), intervention (INT), or <control>control</control> (CON) group. Interventions included a wireless scale (±activity tracker) that transmitted objective data to a mobile app/website, emailed lessons, and tailored feedback based on objective weight (±activity data). Participants completed in-person and online assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Ninety-four percent of participants completed assessments at 3 months, and 97 % at 6 months. <outcome>Median (IQR) weight change</outcome> after 6 months was -0.9 % (-4.4-0.1) in the INT+ (p = 0.075; p = 0.067 vs. CON) and -0.2 % (-4.2-1.3) in the INT groups (p = 0.463; p = 0.357 vs. CON), versus a 0.2 % (-0.7-1.7) gain in the CON group. The proportion of INT+, INT, and CON participants that were at or <outcome>below baseline weight</outcome> was <intervention-value>72.7</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>53.8</intervention-value>, and <control-value>45.5 %</control-value>, respectively (effect sizes d = 0.64, d = 0.18). Most INT+ participants <outcome>weighed and wore trackers ≥5 days/week</outcome> (INT+, <intervention-value>81.9 %</intervention-value> vs. INT, <intervention-value>38.5 %</intervention-value> vs. CON, <control-value>0 %</control-value>; p &lt; 0.0005; INT+, 72.7 %). Both intervention groups <outcome>perceived DSW as positive</outcome>, and 100 % would recommend the program to other breast cancer survivors. An intervention focused on DSW as a self-monitoring strategy shows promise for preventing weight gain in breast cancer survivors. Daily self-monitoring of weight and activity may be a feasible and accessible approach to promote weight gain prevention in breast cancer survivors. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02030353.
