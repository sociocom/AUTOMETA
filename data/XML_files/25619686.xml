Three-Arm Randomized Phase III Trial: <intervention>Quality Aloe</intervention> and <control>Placebo Cream</control> Versus <control>Powder</control> as Skin Treatment During Breast Cancer Radiation Therapy. The efficacy of aloe extract in reducing radiation-induced skin injury is controversial. The purpose of the present 3-arm randomized trial was to test the efficacy of quality-tested aloe extract in reducing the severity of <condition>radiation-induced skin injury</condition> and, secondarily, to examine the effect of a moist cream versus a dry powder skin care regimen. A total of <No-of-participants>248</No-of-participants> <eligibility>patients with breast cancer</eligibility> were randomized to powder, aloe cream, or placebo cream. <outcome-Measure>Acute skin toxicity</outcome-Measure> was scored weekly and after treatment at weeks 1, 2, and 4 using a modified 10-point Catterall scale. The patients scored their symptom severity using a 6-point Likert scale and kept an acute phase diary. The aloe formulation did not reduce <outcome>acute skin toxicity or symptom severity</outcome>. Patients with a greater body mass index were more likely to develop <outcome>acute skin toxicity</outcome>. A similar pattern of increased skin reaction toxicity occurred with both study creams compared with the dry powder regimen. No evidence was found to support prophylactic application of quality aloe extract or cream to improve the symptoms or reduce the skin reaction severity. Our results support a dry skin care regimen of powder during radiation therapy.
