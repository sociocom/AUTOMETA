Combined clinical trial results of a <intervention>HER2/neu (E75) vaccine</intervention> for the prevention of recurrence in high-risk breast cancer patients: <location>U.S</location>. Military Cancer Institute Clinical Trials Group Study I-01 and I-02. E75 is an immunogenic peptide from the HER2/neu protein, which is overexpressed in many breast cancer patients. We have conducted two overlapping E75 vaccine trials to prevent recurrence in <eligibility>node-positive (NP) and node-negative (NN) breast cancer patients</eligibility>. E75 (HER2/neu 369-377) + granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor was given intradermally to previously treated, disease-free NP breast cancer patients in a dose escalation safety trial and to NN breast cancer patients in a dose optimization study. <outcome-Measure>Local and systemic toxicity</outcome-Measure> was monitored. <outcome-Measure>Immunologic responses</outcome-Measure> were assessed using in vitro assays and in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity responses. <outcome-Measure>Clinical recurrences</outcome-Measure> were documented. <No-of-participants>One hundred and eighty-six</No-of-participants> patients were enrolled in the two studies (NP, 95; NN, 91). Human leucocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2) and HLA-A3 patients were vaccinated (n = <intervention-participants>101</intervention-participants>), whereas all others (n = <control-participants>85</control-participants>) were followed prospectively as <control>controls</control>. Toxicities were minimal, and a dose-dependent immunologic response to the vaccine was shown. Planned primary analysis revealed a <outcome>recurrence rate</outcome> of <intervention-value>5.6%</intervention-value> in vaccinated patients compared with <control-value>14.2%</control-value> in the controls (P = 0.04) at a median of 20 months follow-up. As vaccine-specific immunity waned over time, the <outcome>difference in recurrence</outcome> lost significance at 26 months median follow-up (<intervention-value>8.3%</intervention-value> versus <control-value>14.8%</control-value>); however, a significant difference in the pattern of recurrence persisted. E75 is safe and effective in raising a dose-dependent HER2/neu immunity in HLA-A2 and HLA-A3 NP and NN breast cancer patients. More importantly, E75 may reduce recurrences in disease-free, conventionally treated, high-risk breast cancer patients. These findings warrant a prospective, randomized phase III trial of the E75 vaccine with periodic booster to prevent breast cancer recurrences.
