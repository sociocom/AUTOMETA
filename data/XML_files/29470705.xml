The effects of high-dose <intervention>calcitriol</intervention> and individualized <intervention>exercise</intervention> on bone metabolism in <eligibility>breast cancer survivors on hormonal therapy</eligibility>: a phase II feasibility trial. Cancer treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL) is a long-term side effect of breast cancer therapy. Both calcitriol and weight-bearing exercise improve bone metabolism for osteoporotic patients, but are unproven in a breast cancer population. We used a novel high-dose calcitriol regimen with an individualized exercise intervention to improve bone metabolism in breast cancer survivors. We accrued <No-of-participants>41</No-of-participants> subjects to this open label, 2 × 2 factorial, randomized feasibility trial. Breast cancer survivors were randomized to receive the following: (1) calcitriol (45 micrograms/week), (2) individualized exercise with progressive walking and resistance training, (3) both, or (4) a <control>daily multivitamin (control condition)</control> for <duration>12 weeks</duration>. Primary outcomes included <outcome-Measure>changes in biomarkers of bone formation, bone resorption, and the bone remodeling index</outcome-Measure>, a composite measure of bone formation and resorption. <outcome-Measure>Safety measures</outcome-Measure> included clinical and biochemical adverse events. A main effect analysis was used for these endpoints. <outcome>Hypercalcemia</outcome> was limited to three grade I cases with no grade ≥ 2 cases. Among exercisers, 100% engaged in the prescribed aerobic training and 44.4% engaged in the prescribed resistance training. Calcitriol significantly <outcome>improved bone formation</outcome> (Cohen's d = 0.64; p &lt; 0.01), resulting in a non-significant increase in the bone remodeling index (Cohen's d = 0.21; p = 31). Exercise failed to <outcome>improve any of the bone biomarkers</outcome>. Both calcitriol and exercise were shown to be feasible and well tolerated. Calcitriol significantly improved bone formation, resulting in a net increase of bone metabolism. Compliance with the exercise intervention was sub-optimal, which may have led to a lack of effect of exercise on bone metabolism.
