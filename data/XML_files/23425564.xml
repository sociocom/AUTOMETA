Effect of <intervention>everolimus</intervention> on bone marker levels and progressive disease in bone in BOLERO-2. Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus 2 (BOLERO-2), a phase III study in <eligibility>postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing despite nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy</eligibility>, showed statistically significant benefits with adding everolimus to exemestane. Moreover, in preclinical studies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition was associated with decreased osteoclast survival and activity. Exploratory analyses in BOLERO-2 evaluated the effect of everolimus on bone marker levels and progressive disease in bone. Patients were treated with exemestane (25mg/day) and randomized (2:1) to everolimus (10mg/day; combination) or <control>placebo (exemestane only)</control>. Exploratory endpoints included <outcome-Measure>changes in bone turnover marker levels</outcome-Measure> vs <outcome-Measure>baseline and progressive disease in bone</outcome-Measure>, defined as unequivocal progression of a preexisting bone lesion or the appearance of a new bone lesion. <outcome>Baseline disease characteristics</outcome> were well balanced between arms (N = <No-of-participants>724</No-of-participants>); baseline bisphosphonate use was not (<intervention-value>43.9%</intervention-value> combination vs <control-value>54.0%</control-value> exemestane only). At a median of <duration>18 months</duration> of follow-up, median <outcome-Measure>progression-free survival</outcome-Measure> (primary endpoint) was statistically significantly longer with the combination vs exemestane only (Cox proportional hazard ratio = 0.45, 95% confidence interval = 0.38 to 0.54; log-rank, 1-sided P &lt;.0001). <outcome>Bone marker levels</outcome> at 6 and 12 weeks increased with exemestane only, as expected, but decreased with the combination. The <outcome>cumulative incidence rate of progressive disease in bone</outcome> was lower in the combination arm. <outcome>Bone-related adverse events</outcome> occurred with similar frequency in both arms (<intervention-value>3.3%</intervention-value> combination vs <control-value>4.2%</control-value> exemestane only). These exploratory analyses suggest that everolimus has beneficial effects on bone turnover and progressive disease in bone in patients receiving exemestane for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer progressing during/after nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy.
