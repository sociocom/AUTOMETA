A randomised pilot study comparing <intervention>13 G vacuum-assisted biopsy</intervention> and <control>conventional 14 G core needle biopsy</control> of axillary lymph nodes in women with breast cancer. To compare the acceptability, safety, and feasibility of vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) and core needle biopsy (CNB) of axillary lymph nodes in women with breast cancer. This parallel, non-blinded, randomised study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service. Following written informed consent, <eligibility>women with abnormal appearing axillary lymph nodes and radiologically malignant breast masses</eligibility> were randomised 1:1 to lymph node sampling under local anaesthetic with either 14 G CNB or 13 G VAB in a single <location>UK</location> centre. Primary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>study uptake rate</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>patient willingness to undergo a repeat procedure if necessary</outcome-Measure>. <outcome-Measure>Procedure duration</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>immediate and post-procedure pain scores</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>diagnostic yield</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>complications</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>surgical histopathology</outcome-Measure> were recorded. <No-of-participants>Ninety-five</No-of-participants> women were approached; <No-of-participants>81</No-of-participants> (85.3%) consented and were randomised. <control-participants>Forty</control-participants> underwent CNB; <intervention-participants>40</intervention-participants> underwent VAB; one was excluded. Median age was <average-age>57 years</average-age>. The median procedure time was 2 minutes for both techniques. The median number of samples obtained was three for CNB and four for VAB. <outcome>Median pain scores</outcome> for the procedure and first 3 days were 1/10 and 1/10 for CNB and 1/10 and 2/10 for VAB (p=0.11 and 0.04). More women were prepared to <outcome>undergo repeat CNB</outcome> compared to VAB, but the difference was not significant (<intervention-value>38</intervention-value>/<intervention-participants>39</intervention-participants> versus <control-value>33</control-value>/<control-participants>39</control-participants>; p=0.11). <control-value>Two</control-value> patients developed a <outcome>haematoma</outcome> after VAB. <intervention-value>One</intervention-value> CNB and <control-value>six</control-value> VABs <outcome>failed to yield adequate tissue</outcome> (p=0.11), but the <outcome>sensitivity</outcome> was similar at <intervention-value>79%</intervention-value> and <control-value>78%</control-value>. <outcome>Study uptake</outcome> was high. Acceptability of the two procedures was similar, but VAB was associated with more post-procedure pain. The sensitivity appears to be similar.
