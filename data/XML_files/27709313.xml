A randomized, multi-center, open-label, phase III study of once-per-cycle <intervention>DA-3031</intervention>, a pegylated G-CSF, in comparison with daily <control>filgrastim</control> in <eligibility>patients receiving TAC chemotherapy for breast cancer</eligibility>. This multi-center, randomized, phase III study was conducted to demonstrate the non-inferiority of DA-3031 compared with daily filgrastim in patients during the first cycle of chemotherapy for breast cancer in terms of the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN). <No-of-participants>Seventy-four</No-of-participants> <eligibility>patients with breast cancer who were receiving combination chemotherapy with docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC)</eligibility> were enrolled. All participants were randomized to receive either daily subcutaneous injections of filgrastim 100 μg/m2/day for up to 10 days or a single subcutaneous injection of DA-3031 at fixed doses of 6 mg on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle. The <outcome>mean duration of grade 4 (G4) neutropenia in cycle 1</outcome> was 2.08 ± 0.85 days for the filgrastim group and 2.28 ± 1.14 days for the DA-3031 group. The difference between groups was 0.2 ± 1.10 days (95 % confidence interval (CI) = -0.26, 0.66), which supported non-inferiority. No statistically significant differences were observed in <outcome>nadir absolute neutrophil count (ANC)</outcome> (154.34/mm3 and 161.75/mm3 for the filgrastim and DA-3031 groups, respectively; P = 0.8414) or in <outcome>time to ANC recovery</outcome> (10.03 ± 0.75 and 9.83 ± 1.56 days in the filgrastim and DA-3031 groups, respectively; P = 0.0611) during cycle 1. <outcome>Serious AEs</outcome> occurred in <intervention-value>six</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>15.8 %</intervention-value>) patients receiving filgrastim and in <control-value>ten</control-value> (<control-value>27.8 %</control-value>) patients receiving DA-3031; however, none was determined to be related to the study drug. DA-3031 and daily filgrastim are similar in regard to DSN and safety in breast cancer patients receiving TAC chemotherapy.
