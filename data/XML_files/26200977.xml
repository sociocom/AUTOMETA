<intervention>Regional Nodal Irradiation</intervention> in Early-Stage Breast Cancer. Most women with breast cancer who undergo breast-conserving surgery receive whole-breast irradiation. We examined whether the addition of regional nodal irradiation to whole-breast irradiation improved outcomes. We randomly assigned <eligibility>women with node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer who were treated with breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant systemic therapy</eligibility> to undergo either whole-breast irradiation plus regional nodal irradiation (including internal mammary, supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes) (nodal-irradiation group) or <control>whole-breast irradiation alone (control group)</control>. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>overall survival</outcome-Measure>. Secondary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>disease-free survival</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>isolated locoregional disease-free survival</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>distant disease-free survival</outcome-Measure>. <duration>Between March 2000 and February 2007</duration>, a total of <intervention-participants>1832</intervention-participants> women were assigned to the nodal-irradiation group or the control group (<control-participants>916</control-participants> women in each group). The median follow-up was <duration>9.5 years</duration>. At the 10-year follow-up, there was no significant between-group difference in <outcome>survival</outcome>, with a rate of <intervention-value>82.8%</intervention-value> in the nodal-irradiation group and <control-value>81.8%</control-value> in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.13; P=0.38). The <outcome>rates of disease-free survival</outcome> were <intervention-value>82.0%</intervention-value> in the nodal-irradiation group and <control-value>77.0%</control-value> in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.94; P=0.01). Patients in the nodal-irradiation group had higher rates of <outcome>grade 2 or greater acute pneumonitis</outcome> (<intervention-value>1.2%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>0.2%</control-value>, P=0.01) and <outcome>lymphedema</outcome> (<intervention-value>8.4%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>4.5%</control-value>, P=0.001). Among women with node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer, the addition of regional nodal irradiation to whole-breast irradiation did not improve overall survival but reduced the rate of breast-cancer recurrence.
