Effect of a mixed solution of <intervention>sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethyl cellulose</intervention> on <condition>upper limb dysfunction</condition> after total mastectomy: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Restricted shoulder mobility is a major upper limb dysfunction related to lower quality of life and disability after breast cancer surgery. We hypothesized that sodium hyaluronate-carboxymethyl cellulose (HA-CMC) applied to the surface of the pectoralis major muscle after mastectomy would significantly reduce pain and improve range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder in breast cancer patients. We conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of HA-CMC in the prevention of upper limb dysfunction after total mastectomy (TM). A total of <No-of-participants>99</No-of-participants> women with breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the HA-CMC group (n = <intervention-participants>50</intervention-participants>), a mixed HA-CMC was applied to the surface of the pectoralis major and serratus anterior muscle after TM. In the <control>control group</control> (n = <control-participants>49</control-participants>), TM was performed <control>without the use of HA-CMC</control>. The primary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>ROM of the shoulder</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>motion-related pain</outcome-Measure> assessed using a numeric rating scale measured before surgery (T0) and 3 (T1) and 6 months (T2) after surgery. Secondary outcomes included <outcome-Measure>disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH)</outcome-Measure> and the <outcome-Measure>pectoralis minor length test</outcome-Measure>. Compared with the control group, the HA-CMC group showed greater <outcome>reductions in postoperative restriction of total shoulder ROM</outcome> (sum of flexion and horizontal abduction) at 3 months (10.20°, P = 0.004). Mean <outcome>pain levels related to flexion and horizontal abduction</outcome> were significantly lower in the HA-CMC group (-1.32 and -0.93, respectively, P &lt;0.05). The <outcome>DASH score</outcome> was lower (-4.94; P = 0.057) in the HA-CMC group at T2. No adverse effect was observed in either group. These results provide evidence that HA-CMC may provide pain relief and improve ROM of the shoulder without causing adverse effects. The effect on pectoralis tightness should be investigated in further studies.
