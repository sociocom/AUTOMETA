Efficacy of topical <intervention>Calendula officinalis</intervention> on prevalence of <condition>radiation-induced dermatitis</condition>: A randomised controlled trial. A randomised controlled trial was undertaken to compare the efficacy of topical Calendula officinalis (Calendula) versus <control>standard of care (Sorbolene</control>: 10% glycerine in cetomacragol cream) in reducing the prevalence of radiation-induced dermatitis in <eligibility>women undergoing breast cancer radiotherapy</eligibility>. A total of <No-of-participants>271</No-of-participants> women were screened and <No-of-participants>82</No-of-participants> were randomised. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>prevalence of acute radiation-induced dermatitis (RTOG grade 2+) assessed at multiple skin sites</outcome-Measure>. A chi-squared test was conducted for the primary outcome with a worst-case scenario imputation. The recruitment target (n = 178) was not achieved. A total of n = <No-of-participants>81</No-of-participants> participants were analysed (n = <intervention-participants>40</intervention-participants> Calendula; n = <control-participants>41</control-participants> Sorbolene). There was no detectable difference in <outcome>prevalence of radiation-induced dermatitis grade 2+</outcome> between the Calendula (<intervention-value>53%</intervention-value>) and Sorbolene (<control-value>62%</control-value>) groups (primary analysis OR = 0.87, 95% CI: [0.36, 2.09], P = 0.92; covariate adjusted complete case analysis OR 0.40, 95% CI: [0.13, 1.20], P = 0.10). This randomised controlled trial showed no difference between Calendula and standard of care (Sorbolene) for the prevention of radiation-induced dermatitis. However, the study was underpowered (limited recruitment) for the primary comparison.
