Exercise-Induced Dose-Response Alterations in Adiponectin and Leptin Levels Are Dependent on Body Fat Changes in Women at Risk for Breast Cancer. Dysregulation of adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, is associated with a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer. Physical activity protects against breast cancer and one of the mechanisms which may underlie this association is exercise-induced changes in adipokine levels. The WISER Sister Trial was a three-armed randomized controlled trial in <eligibility>premenopausal women</eligibility> (n = <No-of-participants>137</No-of-participants>) <eligibility>with an elevated risk for breast cancer</eligibility>. A 5-menstrual-cycle-long dosed <intervention>aerobic exercise</intervention> intervention compared low-dose exercise (150 min/wk; n = <intervention-participants>44</intervention-participants>) or high-dose exercise (300 min/wk; n = <intervention-participants>48</intervention-participants>) with a <control>control group</control> asked to maintain usual activity levels (n = <control-participants>45</control-participants>). Exercise intensity progressed to and was maintained at 70% to 80% of age predicted heart rate max. <outcome-Measure>Body composition</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>adipokine levels</outcome-Measure> were measured at baseline and follow-up. We observed significant linear trends for <outcome>increased fitness capacity</outcome> (Δ%: -2.0% control, 10.1% low dose, 13.1% high dose), <outcome>decreased fat tissue-to-total tissue mass</outcome> (Δ%: 0.7% control, -2.9% low dose, -3.7% high dose), <outcome>increased body fat adjusted adiponectin</outcome> (Δ%: -0.6% control, 0.6% low dose, 0.9% high dose), and <outcome>decreased body fat adjusted leptin</outcome> (Δ%: 0.7% control, -8.2% low dose, -10.2% high dose). In this randomized clinical trial of premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer, we demonstrate a dose-response effect of exercise on adiponectin and leptin and that dose response is dependent on changes in body fat. Improved adipokine levels, achieved by aerobic exercise training-induced decreases in body fat, may decrease breast cancer risk for high-risk premenopausal women.
