A phase-III prevention trial of low-dose <intervention>tamoxifen</intervention> in postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy users: the HOT study. Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) relieves menopausal symptoms and may decrease mortality in recently postmenopausal women, but increases breast cancer risk. Low-dose tamoxifen has shown retained activity in phase-II studies. We conducted a phase-III trial in <No-of-participants>1884</No-of-participants> <eligibility>recently postmenopausal women on HRT</eligibility> who were randomly assigned to either tamoxifen, 5 mg/day, or <control>placebo</control> for <duration>5 years</duration>. The primary end point was <outcome-Measure>breast cancer incidence</outcome-Measure>. After 6.2 Â± 1.9 years mean follow-up, there were <control-value>24</control-value> <outcome>breast cancers</outcome> on placebo and <intervention-value>19</intervention-value> on tamoxifen (risk ratio, RR, 0.80; 95% CI 0.44-1.46). Tamoxifen showed favorable <outcome>trends in luminal-A tumors</outcome> (RR, 0.32; 95% CI 0.12-0.86), in HRT users &lt; years (RR, 0.35; 95% CI 0.15-0.82) and in women completing at least 12 months of treatment (RR, 0.49; 95% CI 0.23-1.02). Serious adverse events did not differ between placebo and tamoxifen, including, respectively, <outcome>coronary heart syndrome</outcome> (<control-value>6</control-value> versus <intervention-value>4</intervention-value>), <outcome>cerebrovascular events</outcome> (<control-value>2</control-value> versus <intervention-value>5</intervention-value>), <outcome>VTE</outcome> (<control-value>2</control-value> versus <intervention-value>5</intervention-value>) and <outcome>uterine cancers</outcome> (<control-value>3</control-value> versus <intervention-value>1</intervention-value>). <outcome>Vasomotor symptoms</outcome> were <intervention-value>50%</intervention-value> more frequent on tamoxifen. The addition of low-dose tamoxifen to HRT did not significantly reduce breast cancer risk and increased climacteric symptoms in recently postmenopausal women. However, we noted beneficial trends in some subgroups which may deserve a larger study.
