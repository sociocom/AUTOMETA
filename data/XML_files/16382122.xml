Preliminary results on safety and activity of a randomized, double-blind, 2 x 2 trial of low-dose <intervention>tamoxifen</intervention> and <intervention>fenretinide</intervention> for breast cancer prevention in premenopausal women. To determine whether low-dose tamoxifen and fenretinide have a synergistic effect on surrogate biomarkers, including circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and mammographic density, in <eligibility>premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer</eligibility> and to study drug safety. Premenopausal women (n = <No-of-participants>235</No-of-participants>) were randomly assigned in a double-blind four-arm trial to receive <intervention>tamoxifen</intervention> 5 mg/d, <intervention>fenretinide</intervention> 200 mg/d, both agents, or <control>placebo</control> for <duration>2 years</duration>. The present analysis refers to preliminary data on safety, IGF-I, and breast cancer events. Patients were included if they had an excised ductal carcinoma-in-situ (57%), lobular carcinoma-in-situ (13%), minimal invasive breast cancer (7%), or a 5-year Gail risk > or = 1.3% (23%). After a median follow-up of 40 months, there was a reduction of <intervention-value>13%</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>2%</intervention-value>, <intervention-value>20%</intervention-value>, and <control-value>1%</control-value> in <outcome>IGF-I levels</outcome> for patients on tamoxifen, fenretinide, tamoxifen plus fenretinide, and placebo, respectively. Recruitment was stopped based on the lack of an interaction on <outcome-Measure>IGF-I levels</outcome-Measure>, which was a primary end point for the study. Thirty-six patients have dropped out of the study, 17 because of adverse events and 19 for various other reasons. One stage I endometrial cancer occurred in a patient on fenretinide, and one <adverse-effect>optic nerve ischemia</adverse-effect> and one <adverse-effect>deep venous thrombosis</adverse-effect> occurred on tamoxifen. There was <outcome>no difference in menopausal symptoms, endometrial thickness, polyps, or ovarian cysts</outcome> among treatment arms. To date, <control-value>24</control-value> <outcome>breast cancers</outcome> have been observed, without differences among arms. The combination of low-dose tamoxifen and fenretinide is safe but not synergistic in lowering IGF-I levels in premenopausal women. The clinical implications require further follow-up.
