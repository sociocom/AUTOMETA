[Preventive effect of low-dose <intervention>carvedilol</intervention> combined with <intervention>candesartan</intervention> on the <condition>cardiotoxicity</condition> of anthracycline drugs in the adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer]. To investigate the effect of low-dose carvedilol combined with candesartan in the prevention of acute and chronic cardiotoxicity of anthracycline drugs in adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer. <No-of-participants>Forty</No-of-participants> patients were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group with chemotherapy plus low-dose carvedilol combined with candesartan (<intervention-participants>20</intervention-participants> cases) and <control>control group</control> with chemotherapy alone (<control-participants>20</control-participants> cases). The same chemotherapy was given to the two groups. All the 40 patients had no contraindication for carvedilol and candesartan. Patients of the experimental group received low-dose carvedilol from 2.5 mg orally twice a day at first cycle to 5 mg twice a day gradually if no side reactions, and candesartan 2.5 mg orally once a day. <outcome-Measure>Electrocardiogram</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>ultrasonic cardiogram</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>arrhythmia</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>troponin</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>non-hematologic toxicity</outcome-Measure> were recorded and compared after the second, forth and sixth cycle of chemotherapy. Each cycle included <duration>21 days</duration>. <outcome>LVEF</outcome> was decreased along with the prolongation of chemotherapy in the experimental group and control group. <outcome>LVEDD and LVESD</outcome> showed no significant changes in the experimental group, but gradually increased in the control group. <outcome>After four and six cycles of chemotherapy</outcome>, <outcome>LVEF</outcome> were (57.00 ± 5.13)% and (45.95 ± 3.68)%, respectively, in the control group, significantly lower than that of (67.00 ± 5.13)% and (57.50 ± 2.57)%, respectively, in the experimental group (P &lt;0.05). <outcome>After six cycles of chemotherapy,</outcome> <outcome>LVEDD and LVESD</outcome> were (50.00 ± 10.48) mm and (35.01 ± 2.99) mm, respectively, in the control group, significantly higher than those before chemotherapy (P &lt;0.05) and experimental group (P &lt;0.001). The <outcome>rate of ST segment and T wave abnormalities</outcome> was <control-value>80.0%</control-value> in the control group <outcome>after six cycles of chemotherapy</outcome>, significantly higher than that of <control-value>25.0%</control-value> <outcome>after four cycles of chemotherapy</outcome> (P = 0.001) and <control-value>10.0%</control-value> <outcome>after two cycles of chemotherapy</outcome> (P &lt;0.001). The <outcome>reduction of QRS voltage, arrhythmia and abnormal troponin</outcome> were <control-value>55.0%</control-value>, <control-value>45.0%</control-value> and <control-value>45.0%,</control-value> respectively, in the control group, significantly higher than those in the experimental group (<intervention-value>20.0%</intervention-value>, P &lt;0.05), (<intervention-value>10.0%</intervention-value>, P = 0.010) and (<intervention-value>10.0%</intervention-value>, P &lt;0.05), respectively. The <outcome>rate of abnormal expression of troponin</outcome> was <control-value>45.0%</control-value> in the control group, significantly higher than the <intervention-value>10.0%</intervention-value> in the experimental group (P &lt;0.05). The use of low-dose carvedilol combined with candesartan can reduce the acute and chronic cardiotoxicity of anthracycline drugs, and with tolerable toxicities. This may provide a new approach to prevent cardiotoxicity of anthracycline drugs in adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer.
