Tumor factors predictive of response to <intervention>hypofractionated radiotherapy</intervention> in a randomized trial following breast conserving therapy. To determine whether tumor grade, molecular subtype and hypoxia predict response to hypofractionated versus <control>standard radiotherapy (RT)</control> following breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for <eligibility>node-negative breast cancer</eligibility> in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks were available on <No-of-participants>989</No-of-participants> of <No-of-participants>1234</No-of-participants> patients enrolled in the Hypofractionation Whole Breast Irradiation (HWBI) Trial. A central pathology review and assessment of tumor grade using the Nottingham grading system was carried out. Tumors were classified by molecular subtype as luminal A, luminal B, HER2 enriched, basal-like or unclassified using a six-biomarker panel; ER, PR, HER-2, Ki67, CK5/6 and EGFR. Tumors were also classified as hypoxic based on the expression of HIF1Î±, CAIX or GLUT-1. The primary end point was <outcome-Measure>local recurrence (LR)</outcome-Measure>. Median follow-up was <duration>12 years</duration>. In the multivariable Cox model, molecular subtype was the only factor predictive of LR, the <outcome>10-year cumulative incidence</outcome> was <intervention-value>4.5%</intervention-value> for <outcome>luminal A and basal-like</outcome>, <intervention-value>7.9%</intervention-value> for <outcome>luminal B</outcome> and <intervention-value>16.9%</intervention-value> for <outcome>HER-2 enriched tumors</outcome> (P &lt;0.01). Tumor grade, molecular subtype or hypoxia did not predict response to hypofractionation. In women enrolled in the HWBI trial following BCS tumor molecular subtype predicted LR. However tumor grade, molecular subtype and hypoxia did not predict response to hypofractionation suggesting that patients with node-negative breast tumors of all grades and molecular subtypes may be safely treated with hypofractionated RT regimens.
