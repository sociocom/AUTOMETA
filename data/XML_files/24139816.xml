[Interest of a <intervention>thrombin</intervention> and <intervention>fibrinogen combipatch</intervention> in preventing breast cancer <condition>seroma</condition> after lymph node dissection]. To evaluate the effect of <intervention>combipatch TachoSil(®)</intervention> in the prevention of seromas after axillary dissection in local breast cancer. PATIENTS ET MÉTHODES: A retrospective, case-control study conducted <duration>between January 2007 and December 2009</duration>, in two departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the AP-HP. <No-of-participants>Sixty-six</No-of-participants> patients (<control-participants>45</control-participants> in the <control>control group</control> and <intervention-participants>22</intervention-participants> in the group TachoSil(®)) <eligibility>who have undergone an axillary dissection alone, with establishment of a redon or with lumpectomy</eligibility>, were included. The <outcome-Measure>total amount of lymph drained during the stay</outcome-Measure>, the <outcome-Measure>number of days of drainage</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>duration of hospitalization</outcome-Measure>, the <outcome-Measure>number of lymphoceles</outcome-Measure> and the <outcome-Measure>number of retrievals performed at the waning of hospitalization</outcome-Measure> were collected. The population was similar in age, body mass index (BMI), clinical and pathological data. There was no significant difference in terms of <outcome>total volume of lymph drained</outcome> (268.2 ± 220.7 mL without TachoSil(®) and 228.6 ± 128.8 mL with TachoSil(®), P = 0.89) and the <outcome>number of days of drainage</outcome> (3.9 ± 1.6 days without TachoSil(®) and 3.1 ± 0.9 days with TachoSil(®), P = 0.10). The <outcome>duration of hospitalization</outcome> was significantly higher in the group TachoSil(®) (5 ± 1.6 days with TachoSil(®) and 3.8 ± 1.1 days without TachoSil(®), P = 0.006). This study shows no benefit of combipatch (TachoSil(®)) in prevention of seromas after axillary lymph node dissection. A randomized study with large effective is necessary.
