Do coping strategies mediate the effects of <intervention>emotional support</intervention> on <condition>emotional well-being</condition> among <ethinicity>Spanish-speaking Latina</ethinicity> breast cancer survivors? This study aimed to assess the relationship between emotional social support and emotional well-being among Latina immigrants with breast cancer and test whether two culturally relevant coping strategies, fatalism and acceptance, mediate this relationship. <No-of-participants>One hundred fifty</No-of-participants> <eligibility>Spanish-speaking Latinas within 1 year of breast cancer diagnosis</eligibility> participating in a randomized trial of a stress management intervention were assessed in person at baseline and via telephone 6 months later. Survey measures included <outcome-Measure>baseline emotional support</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>fatalism</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>acceptance and emotional well-being</outcome-Measure> 6 months later. Generalized linear models estimated direct effects of emotional support on emotional well-being and indirect effects through fatalism and acceptance. Mean age was <average-age>50.1 (SD = 10.9) years</average-age>; most women had low education and acculturation levels. Emotional support was negatively associated with <outcome>fatalism</outcome> (r = -0.24, p &lt; 0.01) and positively associated with <outcome>acceptance</outcome> (r = 0.30, p &lt; 0.001). Emotional support (r = 0.23, p = 0.005) and acceptance (r = 0.28, p = 0.001) were positively associated with <outcome>emotional well-being</outcome>, whereas <outcome>fatalism</outcome> (r = -0.36, p &lt; 0.0001) was negatively associated with emotional well-being. In multivariable models, emotional support was associated with <outcome>emotional well-being</outcome> (b = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.24, 1.52). This direct effect remained significant when additionally controlling for fatalism (b = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.30) and acceptance (b = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.09, 1.37) in separate models. There was a significant indirect effect of emotional support on emotional well-being through fatalism (b = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.51) as well as a marginally significant effect through acceptance (b = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.43). Emotional support may increase well-being among Spanish-speaking Latina cancer survivors by reducing cancer fatalism.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
