Pooled analysis of two randomized, double-blind trials comparing proposed biosimilar <intervention>LA-EP2006</intervention> with <control>reference pegfilgrastim</control> in breast cancer. Following the functional and physicochemical characterization of a proposed biosimilar, comparative clinical studies help to confirm biosimilarity by demonstrating similar safety and efficacy to the reference product in a sensitive patient population. LA-EP2006 is a proposed biosimilar that has been developed for pegfilgrastim, a long-acting form of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for the prevention of neutropenia. The current analysis reports data pooled from two independent, multinational, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind phase III studies of similar design comparing the safety and efficacy of reference pegfilgrastim with LA-EP2006 in <eligibility>patients with breast cancer receiving myelotoxic (neo)adjuvant TAC (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy and requiring granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</eligibility>. A total of <No-of-participants>624</No-of-participants> patients were randomized in the PROTECT-1 and PROTECT-2 studies (NCT01735175; NCT01516736) (LA-EP2006: n = <intervention-participants>314</intervention-participants>; reference: n =<control-participants> 310</control-participants>). Baseline characteristics of patients were well balanced across treatment groups. The primary end point, <outcome>mean duration of severe neutropenia</outcome> in the first chemotherapy cycle was similar in both the LA-EP2006 and reference groups (1.05 ± 1.055 days versus 1.01 ± 0.958 days), with a treatment difference of - 0.04 days [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.19 to 0.11] that met the equivalence criteria (the 95% CI were within the defined margin of ±1 day). Secondary end points, such as the <outcome>nadir of absolute neutrophil count</outcome> and the <outcome>incidence of febrile neutropenia</outcome>, were also similar between LA-EP2006 and reference pegfilgrastim. The <outcome>safety and tolerability profile</outcome> of LA-EP2006 was similar to that observed with reference pegfilgrastim, and there were no reports of neutralizing antibodies. This pooled analysis confirms, as a part of totality of evidence approach, that the proposed biosimilar pegfilgrastim LA-EP2006 has a comparable efficacy and safety profile to reference pegfilgrastim in patients with breast cancer receiving TAC chemotherapy.
