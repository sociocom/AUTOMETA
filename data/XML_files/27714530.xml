Efficacy of <intervention>ginger</intervention> for prophylaxis of <condition>chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</condition> in <eligibility>breast cancer patients receiving adriamycin-cyclophosphamide regimen</eligibility>: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of ginger for reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in breast cancer patients receiving adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (AC) regimens. We enrolled <eligibility>breast cancer patients receiving AC who experienced moderate to severe nausea or vomiting during the first chemotherapy cycle</eligibility>. Subjects were randomized to receive a 500-mg ginger capsule or <control>placebo</control> twice a day for <duration>5 days</duration> starting on the first day of the second AC cycle and were switched to the other treatment in the third cycle. All participants also received ondansetron and dexamethasone for CINV prophylaxis. <outcome-Measure>Nausea severity</outcome-Measure> was recorded once a day during the first 5 days of each cycle. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>reduction in nausea score</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>Thirty-four</No-of-participants> subjects (68 cycles of AC) were enrolled. Mean (range) maximum nausea score in the first AC cycle was 58 (40-90). <No-of-participants>Thirty-three</No-of-participants> subjects (97 %) received the same AC doses in the second as in the third cycle. Mean (±standard error) <outcome>maximum nausea scores</outcome> in patients receiving ginger and placebo were 35.36 (±4.43) and 32.17 (±3.71), respectively. The <outcome>difference in mean maximum nausea scores</outcome> was 3 (95 % confidence interval, -3 to 9; P = 0.3). There were no significant differences between ginger and placebo in terms of <outcome>vomiting incidence and severity, rescue medication use, chemotherapy compliance, and adverse events</outcome>. Ginger (500 mg) twice daily was safe, but conferred no additional benefit in terms of reducing nausea severity in breast cancer patients receiving AC and ondansetron and dexamethasone for CINV prophylaxis.
