A Randomized Trial Evaluating <intervention>Bioimpedance Spectroscopy</intervention> Versus <control>Tape Measurement</control> for the Prevention of <condition>Lymphedema</condition> Following Treatment for Breast Cancer: Interim Analysis. Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) represents a major source of morbidity among breast cancer survivors. Increasing data support early detection of subclinical BCRL followed by early intervention. A randomized controlled trial is being conducted comparing lymphedema progression rates using volume measurements calculated from the circumference using a tape measure (TM) or bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS). Patients were enrolled and randomized to either TM or BIS surveillance. Patients requiring early intervention were prescribed a compression sleeve and gauntlet for 4 weeks and then re-evaluated. The primary endpoint of the trial was the <outcome-Measure>rate of progression to clinical lymphedema requiring complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP)</outcome-Measure>, with progression defined as a TM volume change in the at-risk arm ≥ 10% above the presurgical baseline. This prespecified interim analysis was performed when at least 500 trial participants had ≥ 12 months of follow-up. A total of <No-of-participants>508</No-of-participants> patients were included in this analysis, with 109 (21.9%) patients triggering prethreshold interventions. Compared with TM, BIS had a lower <outcome>rate of trigger</outcome> (<intervention-value>15.8%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>28.5%</control-value>, p &lt; 0.001) and longer <outcome>times to trigger</outcome> (9.5 vs. 2.8 months, p = 0.002). Twelve <outcome>triggering patients progressed to CDP</outcome> (<control-value>10</control-value> in the TM group [<control-value>14.7%</control-value>] and <intervention-value>2</intervention-value> in the BIS group [<intervention-value>4.9%</intervention-value>]), representing a 67% relative reduction and a 9.8% absolute reduction (p = 0.130). Interim results demonstrated that post-treatment surveillance with BIS reduced the absolute rates of progression of BCRL requiring CDP by approximately 10%, a clinically meaningful improvement. These results support the concept of post-treatment surveillance with BIS to detect subclinical BCRL and initiate early intervention.
