Quality of life under extended continuous versus intermittent adjuvant <intervention>letrozole</intervention> in lymph node-positive, early breast cancer patients: the SOLE randomised phase 3 trial. In the phase III SOLE trial, the extended use of intermittent versus continuous letrozole for <duration>5 years</duration> did not improve disease-free survival in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Intermittent therapy with 3-month breaks may be beneficial for patients' quality of life (QoL). In the SOLE QoL sub-study, <No-of-participants>956</No-of-participants> patients completed the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) symptom and further QoL scales up to <duration>24 months</duration> after randomisation. Differences in change of QoL from baseline between the two administration schedules were tested at 12 and 24 months using repeated measures mixed-models. The primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>change in hot flushes at 12 months</outcome-Measure>. There was <outcome>no difference in hot flushes at 12 months</outcome> between the two schedules, but patients receiving intermittent letrozole reported significantly more improvement at 24 months. They also indicated <outcome>less worsening in vaginal problems, musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, physical well-being and mood at 12 months</outcome>. Overall, 25-30% of patients reported a <outcome>clinically relevant worsening in key symptoms and global Qo</outcome>L. Less symptom worsening was observed during the first year of extended treatment with the intermittent administration. For women experiencing an increased symptom burden of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy, an intermittent administration is a safe alternative. Clinical trial information: NCT00651456.
