Randomized trial of a <intervention>lay health advisor and computer intervention</intervention> to increase mammography screening in <ethinicity>African American</ethinicity> women. Low-income African American women face numerous barriers to mammography screening. We tested the efficacy of a combined interactive computer program and lay health advisor intervention to increase mammography screening. In this randomized, single blind study, participants were <No-of-participants>181</No-of-participants> African American female health center patients of ages <average-age>41 to 75 years</average-age>, at &lt; or =250% of poverty level, <eligibility>with no breast cancer history, and with no screening mammogram in the past 15 months</eligibility>. They were assigned to either (a) a low-dose <control>comparison group</control> consisting of a culturally appropriate mammography screening pamphlet or (b) interactive, tailored computer instruction at baseline and four monthly lay health advisor counseling sessions. <outcome-Measure>Self-reported screening data</outcome-Measure> were collected at baseline and 6 months and verified by medical record. For intent-to-treat analysis of primary outcome (medical record-verified mammography screening, available on all but two participants), the intervention group had <outcome>increased screening</outcome> to <intervention-value>51%</intervention-value> (<intervention-value>45</intervention-value> of <intervention-participants>89</intervention-participants>) compared with <control-value>18%</control-value> (<control-value>16</control-value> of <control-participants>90</control-participants>) for the comparison group at 6 months. When adjusted for employment status, disability, first-degree relatives with breast cancer, health insurance, and previous breast biopsies, the intervention group was three times more likely (adjusted relative risk, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-3.7; P &lt;0.0001) to get screened than the low-dose comparison group. Similar results were found for self-reported mammography stage of screening adoption. The combined intervention was efficacious in improving mammography screening in low-income African American women, with an unadjusted effect size (relative risk, 2.84) significantly higher (P &lt;0.05) than that in previous studies of each intervention alone.
