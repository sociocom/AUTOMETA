Intake of <intervention>vitamin D</intervention> and <intervention>calcium</intervention>, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women. The randomized placebo-controlled Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial suggested a possible benefit of vitamin D on cancer incidence among <ethinicity>black</ethinicity> individuals. However, data are limited regarding the impact of vitamin D on breast cancer subtypes among <ethinicity>African-American/black</ethinicity> women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of breast cancer. We hypothesize that more vitamin D exposure (through diet, supplements, and sunlight) and higher intake of calcium are associated with decreased risk of estrogen receptor (ER)+ and ER- breast cancer, and of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) among black women. This study was conducted among <intervention-participants>1724</intervention-participants> black cases and <control-participants>1233</control-participants> <control>controls</control> in the Women's Circle of Health Study (WCHS) and WCHS2. Polytomous logistic regressions were used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of ER+ and ER- breast cancer; logistic regressions were used for TNBC. The ORs from each study were pooled using an inverse-variance-weighted random-effects model. <outcome>Dietary vitamin D and calcium intake</outcome> were not associated with risk of breast cancer subtypes in the pooled analysis. For supplemental vitamin D, we observed possible inverse associations between intake of ≤800 IU/d (compared with nonuse) and <outcome>risk of several subtypes</outcome>, with effects that appeared strongest for TNBC (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.94); no association was found for >800 IU/d. More daylight hours spent outdoors in a year was associated with lower <outcome>risk of ER+, ER-, and TNBC</outcome> (e.g., highest compared with lowest quartile: TNBC OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.91; P-trend = 0.02). Moderate supplemental vitamin D intake was associated with decreased risk of TNBC, and increased sun exposure was associated with reduced risk of ER+, ER-, and TNBC among black women.
