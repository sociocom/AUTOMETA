Randomized placebo-controlled study of <intervention>recombinant human interleukin-11</intervention> to prevent <condition>chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia</condition> in <eligibility>patients with breast cancer receiving dose-intensive cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin</eligibility>. Thrombocytopenia may compromise cancer treatment, causing chemotherapy dose reductions, schedule alterations, or the need for platelet transfusions. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11; Neumega, Genetics Institute, Inc, Cambridge, MA), a novel thrombopoietic growth factor, in reducing the need for platelet transfusions in patients who undergo dose-intensive chemotherapy. Women with advanced breast cancer received cyclophosphamide (3,200 mg/m2) and doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; 5 microg/kg/d). Patients were randomized to blinded treatment with <control>placebo</control> or 50 microg/kg/d rhIL-11 subcutaneously for <duration>10 or 17 days</duration> after the first two chemotherapy cycles. <No-of-participants>Seventy-seven</No-of-participants> patients were randomized and constitute the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. <No-of-participants>Sixty-seven</No-of-participants> patients (the assessable subgroup) either completed both cycles without a major protocol violation (n = 62) or received a platelet transfusion before treatment was discontinued after the first cycle. In the ITT population, rhIL-11 significantly decreased the requirement for <outcome>platelet transfusions</outcome>; <intervention-value>27</intervention-value> of <intervention-participants>40</intervention-participants> (<intervention-value>68%</intervention-value>) patients who received rhIL-11 did not require transfusions, compared with <control-value>15</control-value> of <control-participants>37</control-participants> (<control-value>41%</control-value>) in the placebo group (P = .04). Treatment with rhIL-11 significantly reduced the total number of platelet transfusions required in the assessable subgroup (P = .03) and the time to platelet recovery to more than 50,000/microL in the second cycle (P = .01). Most <outcome>adverse events</outcome> associated with rhIL-11 were reversible, mild to moderate in severity, and likely related to fluid retention. rhIL-11 is safe and effective in reducing treatment-associated thrombocytopenia and the need for platelet transfusions in patients who undergo dose-intensive chemotherapy, and thus may permit chemotherapy to be administered as planned at intended doses and thereby maximize the potential for a successful outcome.
