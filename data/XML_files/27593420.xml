<intervention>Technology- and Phone-Based Weight Loss</intervention> Intervention: Pilot RCT in <eligibility>Women at Elevated Breast Cancer Risk</eligibility>. For women with an increased breast cancer risk, reducing excess weight and increasing physical activity are believed to be important approaches for reducing their risk. This study tested a weight loss intervention that combined commercially available technology-based self-monitoring tools with individualized phone calls. Women were randomized to a weight loss intervention arm (n=<intervention-participants>36</intervention-participants>) or a <control>usual care</control> arm (n=<control-participants>18</control-participants>). Participants were <eligibility>women with a BMI â‰¥ 27.5 kg/m2 and elevated breast cancer risk</eligibility> recruited from the mammography clinic at the Moores Cancer Center at the University of <location>California San Diego</location>. Intervention participants used the MyFitnessPal website and phone app to monitor diet and a Fitbit to monitor physical activity. Participants received 12 standardized coaching calls with trained counselors over <duration>6 months</duration>. Usual care participants received the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans at baseline and two brief calls over the 6 months. <outcome-Measure>Weight</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>accelerometer-measured physical activity</outcome-Measure> were assessed at baseline and 6 months. Data were collected in <location>San Diego, CA</location>, <duration>from 2012 to 2014</duration> and analyzed in 2015. Participants (n=<No-of-participants>54</No-of-participants>) had a mean age of <average-age>59.5 (SD=5.6) years</average-age>, BMI of 31.9 (SD=3.5), and a mean Gail Model score of 2.5 (SD=1.4). At 6 months, intervention participants had <outcome>lost significantly more weight</outcome> (4.4 kg vs 0.8 kg, p=0.004) and a greater percentage of starting weight (<intervention-value>5.3%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>1.0%</control-value>, p=0.005) than usual care participants. Across arms, greater increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity resulted in greater weight loss (p=0.01). Combining technology-based self-monitoring tools with phone counseling supported weight loss over 6 months in women at increased risk for breast cancer.
