A randomized phase II study evaluating <intervention>pyridoxine</intervention> for the prevention of <condition>hand-foot syndrome</condition> associated with capecitabine therapy for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Pyridoxine, an activated form of vitamin B6 used to treat allergic dermatitis, may prevent capecitabine-associated hand-foot syndrome (HFS), although evidence of the benefit of prophylactic pyridoxine is lacking. The aim of this open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II study was to determine whether prophylactic pyridoxine could delay the onset of capecitabine-induced HFS in <eligibility>patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer</eligibility>. Patients received either concomitant pyridoxine (60 mg per day; pyridoxine group), or <control>no pyridoxine</control> but treatment with capecitabine-containing regimens (no pyridoxine group). Study treatment was administered until the development of grade 2 or worse HFS or disease progression. The primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>time to onset of grade 2 or worse HFS from the start of protocol treatment</outcome-Measure>. A total of <No-of-participants>135</No-of-participants> patients were randomized to the pyridoxine (n = <intervention-participants>67</intervention-participants>) or no pyridoxine (n = <control-participants>68</control-participants>) groups. <outcome>Grade 2 or worse HFS</outcome> developed in <intervention-value>19</intervention-value> of <intervention-participants>66</intervention-participants> patients (<intervention-value>28.8%</intervention-value>) versus <control-value>21</control-value> of <control-participants>67</control-participants> patients (<control-value>31.3%</control-value>) in the pyridoxine and no pyridoxine groups, respectively. The <outcome>median time to onset of grade 2 or worse HFS</outcome> was 13.6 and 10.6 months in the pyridoxine and no pyridoxine groups, respectively [hazard ratio = 0.75 (80% confidence interval 0.50-1.13), one-sided P = 0.18]. Prophylactic pyridoxine was not shown to have an effect on the onset of capecitabine-associated HFS in this study.
