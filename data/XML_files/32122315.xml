A protocol for a multicentre, parallel-group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial to evaluate the NEVERMIND system in preventing and treating <condition>depression</condition> in patients with severe somatic conditions. Depressive symptoms are common in individuals suffering from severe somatic conditions. There is a lack of interventions and evidence-based interventions aiming to reduce depressive symptoms in patients with severe somatic conditions. The aim of the NEVERMIND project is to address these issues and provide evidence by testing the NEVERMIND system, designed to reduce and prevent depressive symptoms in comparison to treatment as usual. The NEVERMIND study is a parallel-groups, pragmatic randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of the NEVERMIND system in reducing depressive symptoms among individuals with severe somatic conditions. The NEVERMIND system comprises a smart shirt and a user interface, in the form of a mobile application. The system is a <intervention>real-time decision support system</intervention>, aiming to predict the severity and onset of depressive symptoms by modelling the well-being condition of patients based on physiological data, body movement, and the recurrence of social interactions. The study includes <No-of-participants>330</No-of-participants> <eligibility>patients who have a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer, kidney failure, or lower limb amputation</eligibility>. Participants are randomised in blocks of ten to either the NEVERMIND intervention or <control>treatment as usual as the control group</control>. Clinical interviews and structured questionnaires are administered at baseline, at 12 weeks, and 24 weeks to assess whether the NEVERMIND system is superior to treatment as usual. The endpoint of primary interest is <outcome-Measure>Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) at 12 weeks</outcome-Measure> defined as (i) the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the BDI-II. Secondary outcomes include <outcome-Measure>prevention of the onset of depressive symptoms, changes in quality of life, perceived stigma, and self-efficacy</outcome-Measure>. There is a lack of evidence-based interventions aiming to reduce and prevent depressive symptoms in patients with severe somatic conditions. If the NEVERMIND system is effective, it will provide healthcare systems with a novel and innovative method to attend to depressive symptoms in patients with severe somatic conditions. DRKS00013391.
