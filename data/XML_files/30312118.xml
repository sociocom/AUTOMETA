A Randomized Controlled Trial of Exercise to Prevent <condition>Bone Loss</condition> in Premenopausal Women with Breast Cancer. Background/Introduction/Objective: Premenopausal women treated for breast cancer are at high risk for bone loss. This trial examined the effects of a <duration>1-year</duration> <intervention>combined aerobic and resistance exercise</intervention> program on bone mineral density (BMD) in women treated for premenopausal breast cancer. <eligibility>Premenopausal women</eligibility> (n = <No-of-participants>206</No-of-participants>) age <average-age>≤ 55 years</average-age> at cancer diagnosis who were within two years of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized to a <duration>12-month</duration> exercise program or a <control>control group</control>. <outcome-Measure>BMD</outcome-Measure> was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 1 year; blood was drawn for skeletal markers. Change from baseline to end of study was compared within and between treatment groups using paired and unpaired t-tests. <outcome>Lumbar spine BMD declined</outcome> in both treatment groups with no significant difference between treatment groups (-0.008 ± 0.003 g/cm2 exercise vs. -0.014 ± 0.003 g/cm2 control, p = 0.24). However, among the women who did not lose lean mass during the study (n = <No-of-participants>100</No-of-participants>, <control-participants>54</control-participants> control, <intervention-participants>46</intervention-participants> exercise), the exercise intervention prevented lumbar spine bone loss (0.001 ± 0.005 g/cm2 treatment group vs. -0.014 ± 0.005 g/cm2 control group, p = 0.03). <outcome>Bone turnover markers decreased</outcome> significantly in both groups with no differences between groups. Among women who maintained lean mass, our exercise intervention prevented bone loss; however, our intervention did not prevent bone loss among women who lost muscle mass. Additional investigation into exercise regimens that can prevent both bone and muscle loss may help prevent long-term consequences of premenopausal breast cancer treatment.
