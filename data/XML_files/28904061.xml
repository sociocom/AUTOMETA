A Randomized Controlled Trial of <intervention>Green Tea Extract</intervention> Supplementation and Mammographic Density in <eligibility>Postmenopausal Women at Increased Risk of Breast Cancer.</eligibility> Epidemiologic and animal studies suggest a protective role of green tea against breast cancer. However, the underlying mechanism is not understood. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial to investigate whether supplementation with green tea extract (GTE) modifies mammographic density (MD), as a potential mechanism, involving <No-of-participants>1,075</No-of-participants> healthy postmenopausal women. Women assigned to the treatment arm consumed daily 4 decaffeinated GTE capsules containing 1,315 mg total catechins, including 843 mg epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) for <duration>12 months</duration>. A computer-assisted method (Madena) was used to assess MD in digital mammograms at baseline and month 12 time points in <No-of-participants>932</No-of-participants> completers (<intervention-participants>462</intervention-participants> in GTE and <control-participants>470</control-participants> in <control>placebo</control>). GTE supplementation for 12 months did not significantly change <outcome>percent MD (PMD) or absolute MD</outcome> in all women. <outcome>In younger women (50-55 years)</outcome>, GTE supplementation significantly <outcome>reduced PMD</outcome> by <intervention-value>4.40%</intervention-value> as compared with the placebo with a <control-value>1.02%</control-value> PMD increase from pre- to postintervention (P = 0.05), but had <outcome>no effect in older women</outcome> (Pinteraction = 0.07). GTE supplementation did not <outcome>induce MD change</outcome> in other subgroups of women stratified by catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype or level of body mass index. In conclusion, 1-year supplementation with a high dose of EGCG did not have a significant effect on MD measures in all women, but reduced PMD in younger women, an age-dependent effect similar to those of tamoxifen. Further investigation of the potential chemopreventive effect of green tea intake on breast cancer risk in younger women is warranted. Cancer Prev Res; 10(12); 710-8. Â©2017 AACR.
