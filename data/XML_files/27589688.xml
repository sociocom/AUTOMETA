Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the <intervention>HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine</intervention> in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence. GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide. Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic. Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy. The trial enrolled <eligibility>HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+)</eligibility>. Patients were randomized to <intervention>GP2+GM-CSF</intervention> versus <control>GM-CSF alone</control>. <outcome-Measure>Disease-free survival (DFS)</outcome-Measure> was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease. The trial enrolled <No-of-participants>180</No-of-participants> patients; <intervention-participants>89</intervention-participants> received GP2+GM-CSF and <control-participants>91</control-participants> received GM-CSF alone. The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics. Toxicities have been minimal. The <outcome>Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses</outcome> was <intervention-value>88%</intervention-value> (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. <control-value>81%</control-value> (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up. In the <outcome>per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates</outcome> were <intervention-value>94%</intervention-value> (95% CI:83-98%) and <control-value>85%</control-value> (73-92%) (P = 0.17). <outcome>In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate</outcome> was <intervention-value>94%</intervention-value> (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = <intervention-participants>51</intervention-participants>) vs. <control-value>89%</control-value> (71-96%) in control patients (n = <control-participants>50</control-participants>), (P = 0.86) in the <outcome>ITT analyses</outcome> and <intervention-value>100%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>89%</control-value> (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08). While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).
