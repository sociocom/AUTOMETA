<intervention>Accelerated partial breast irradiation</intervention> using intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique compared to <control>whole breast irradiation</control> for patients aged 70 years or older: subgroup analysis from a randomized phase 3 trial. The purpose of this study was to report the efficacy and the safety profile on the subset of selected early breast cancer (BC) patients aged 70 years or older from a single-center phase 3 trial comparing whole breast irradiation (WBI) to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique. <duration>Between 2005 and 2013</duration>, <No-of-participants>520</No-of-participants> patients aged <average-age>more than 40 years</average-age> old were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either WBI or APBI in a 1:1 ratio. Eligible patients were <eligibility>women with early BC (maximum diameter 2.5 cm) suitable for breast conserving surgery</eligibility>. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02104895. A total of <No-of-participants>117</No-of-participants> patients <average-age>aged 70 years or more</average-age> were analyzed (<control-participants>58</control-participants> in the WBI arm, <intervention-participants>59</intervention-participants> in the APBI arm). At a median follow-up of 5-years (range 3.4-7.0), the <outcome>ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) rate</outcome> was <intervention-value>1.9 %</intervention-value> in both groups. No significant difference between the two groups was identified (log-rank test p = 0.96). The <outcome>5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates</outcome> in the WBI group and APBI group were <control-value>6.1</control-value> and <intervention-value>1.9 %</intervention-value>, respectively (p = 0.33). The APBI group presented significantly better results in terms of <outcome>acute skin toxicity</outcome>, considering both any grade (p = 0.0001) and <outcome>grade 2 or higher</outcome> (p = 0.0001). Our subgroup analyses showed a very low rate and no significant difference in terms of IBTR, using both WBI and APBI. A significant impact on patients compliance in terms of acute and early late toxicity was shown, which could translate in a consistent improvement of overall quality of life.
