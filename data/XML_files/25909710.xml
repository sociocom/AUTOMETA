Plasma TNF-α and Soluble TNF Receptor Levels after Doxorubicin with or without Co-Administration of Mesna-A Randomized, Cross-Over Clinical Study. Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is a common sequelae of cancer therapy. Recent preclinical observations have suggested that CICI can be mediated by chemotherapy-induced plasma protein oxidation, which triggers TNF-α mediated CNS damage. This study evaluated <intervention>sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (Mesna)</intervention> co-administration with <intervention>doxorubicin</intervention> to reduce doxorubicin-induced plasma protein oxidation and resultant cascade of TNF-α, soluble TNF receptor levels and related cytokines. <No-of-participants>Thirty-two</No-of-participants> evaluable patients were randomized using a crossover design to receive mesna or <control>saline</control> in either the first or second cycle of doxorubicin in the context of a standard chemotherapy regimen for either non-Hodgkin lymphoma or breast cancer. Mesna (360 mg/m2) or saline administration occurred 15 minutes prior and three hours post doxorubicin. <outcome-Measure>Pre-treatment and post-treatment measurements of oxidative stress</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>TNF-α</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>related cytokines</outcome-Measure> were evaluated during the two experimental cycles of chemotherapy. Co-administration of mesna with chemotherapy reduced post-treatment <outcome>levels of TNF-related cytokines and TNF-receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF-receptor 2</outcome> (TNFR2) (p = 0.05 and p = 0.002, respectively). Patients with the highest pre-treatment levels of each cytokine and its receptors were the most likely to benefit from mesna co-administration. The extracellular anti-oxidant mesna, when co-administered during a single cycle of doxorubicin, reduced levels of TNF-α and its receptors after that cycle of therapy, demonstrating for the first time a clinical interaction between mesna and doxorubicin, drugs often coincidentally co-administered in multi-agent regimens. These findings support further investigation to determine whether rationally-timed mesna co-administration with redox active chemotherapy may prevent or reduce the cascade of events that lead to CICI. clinicaltrials.gov NCT01205503.
