<intervention>Topical silver sulfadiazine</intervention> for the prevention of <condition>acute dermatitis</condition> during irradiation for breast cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of topical silver sulfadiazine (SSD) in preventing acute radiation dermatitis in women receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer. A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on <eligibility>patients with breast cancer referred for radiotherapy after treatment with mastectomy and chemotherapy</eligibility>. The patients were randomized into the intervention (n = <intervention-participants>51</intervention-participants>) and <control>control</control> (n = <control-participants>51</control-participants>) groups and were instructed on general skin care during radiotherapy. The intervention group received SSD cream 1%, three times a day, 3 days a week, for 5 weeks during radiotherapy and one week thereafter. A blinded observer assessed the <outcome-Measure>severity of dermatitis weekly</outcome-Measure> (for <duration>6 weeks</duration>) and graded it from 0 to 4 according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. The two groups were similar in baseline characteristics. <control-value>Two</control-value> patients in the control group <outcome>discontinued the radiotherapy course</outcome> because of <adverse-effect>severe skin injuries</adverse-effect> (grades 3 and 4). The intervention group encountered significantly <outcome>less severe dermatitis during radiotherapy</outcome> compared to the controls. The <outcome>total score of skin injury</outcome> was also lower in the intervention group compared with controls (5.49 ± 1.02 vs. 7.21 ± 1.76, p &lt; 0.001). A multivariate analysis found that the use of SSD cream (p &lt; 0.001) and flat chest wall anatomy (p = 0.008) were significantly associated with a <outcome>decreased skin injury</outcome>. SSD cream reduced the <outcome>severity of radiation-induced skin injury</outcome> compared with general skin care alone. Further studies in patients with other types of cancer and also comparing SSD cream with other topical agents are warranted.
