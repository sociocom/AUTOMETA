Effects of <intervention>exercise dose</intervention> and type during breast cancer chemotherapy on longer-term patient-reported outcomes and health-related fitness: A randomized controlled trial. The Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise (CARE) Trial compared different types and doses of exercise performed during breast cancer chemotherapy. Here, we report the longer-term follow-up of patient-reported outcomes, health-related fitness and exercise behavior at 6, 12 and 24 months postintervention. A multicenter trial in <location>Canada</location> randomized <No-of-participants>301</No-of-participants> <eligibility>breast cancer patients initiating chemotherapy to thrice weekly</eligibility>, supervised exercise consisting of a <control>standard dose</control> of 25-30 min of aerobic exercise (STAN; n = 96), a higher dose of 50-60 min of aerobic exercise (HIGH; n = 101) or a combined dose of 50-60 min of aerobic and resistance exercise (COMB; n = 104) performed for the duration of chemotherapy (median of 17 weeks). Primary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>patient-reported outcomes including quality of life, cancer-related symptoms and psychosocial outcomes</outcome-Measure>. Secondary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>objective health-related fitness (assessed at 12 months only)</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>self-reported exercise behavior</outcome-Measure>. A total of <No-of-participants>269</No-of-participants> (89.4%) participants completed patient-reported outcomes at all three follow-up time points and <No-of-participants>263</No-of-participants> (87.4%) completed the health-related fitness assessment at 12-month follow-up. COMB was significantly superior to (i) STAN for <outcome>sleep quality at 6-month follow-up</outcome> (p = 0.027); (ii) HIGH for <outcome>upper body muscular endurance at 12-month follow-up</outcome> (p = 0.020); and (iii) HIGH for <outcome>meeting the resistance exercise guideline at 6-month follow-up</outcome> (p = 0.006). Moreover, self-reported meeting of the combined exercise guideline during follow-up was significantly associated with <outcome>better patient-reported outcomes and health-related fitness</outcome>. Performing combined exercise during and after breast cancer chemotherapy may result in better longer-term patient-reported outcomes and health-related fitness compared to performing aerobic exercise alone.
