Randomized controlled trial of high-dose versus standard-dose <intervention>vitamin D3</intervention> for prevention of <condition>aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia</condition>. Half of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer patients will develop joint pain, termed aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia (AIA), while taking aromatase inhibitor therapy. Though there is no universally accepted effective treatment for AIA, there has been some evidence to support high-dose vitamin D as a treatment. We randomized <eligibility>post-menopausal women who were beginning adjuvant AI therapy</eligibility> to receive <control>standard-dose vitamin D3</control> (800 IU daily for 52 weeks), or high-dose vitamin D3 (50,000 IU weekly for <duration>12 weeks,</duration> followed by 2000 IU daily for 40 weeks). The primary end point was <outcome-Measure>development of AIA</outcome-Measure>. The trial was designed to enroll <No-of-participants>184</No-of-participants> patients. This futility analysis was performed after <No-of-participants>93</No-of-participants> patients were enrolled. The high-dose vitamin D regimen was effective in raising <outcome>serum vitamin D levels</outcome>, but there was no significant difference in development of AIA between the two arms. In the high-dose arm, <intervention-value>25</intervention-value> patients (<intervention-value>54%</intervention-value>) <outcome>developed AIA</outcome>, compared to <control-value>27</control-value> patients (<control-value>57%</control-value>) in the standard-dose arm. The planned futility analysis was positive; thus, the study was terminated. Neither baseline vitamin D nor 12-week vitamin D level was predictive of AIA development. Although vitamin D levels were increased in the high-dose arm, there was no significant signal for benefit of high-dose vitamin D supplementation for AIA prevention in this unblinded trial. This study, along with several others, implies that vitamin D likely does not play a significant role in AIA for the majority of patients.
