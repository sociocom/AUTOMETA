Prospective comparison of <intervention>Sapylin</intervention> and <intervention>Avitene</intervention> for reducing <condition>hydrops</condition> after axillary lymphadenectomy in breast cancer patients. This study compared the efficacy of Sapylin and Avitene in reducing postoperative axillary seroma formation and effusion when applied topically after axillary lymphadenectomy. A total of <No-of-participants>224</No-of-participants> patients were randomly divided into a Sapylin treatment group (STG), an Avitene treatment group, and a <control>control group</control> (CG). All patients underwent axillary lymphadenectomy and were treated during surgery with Sapylin, Avitene, or neither according to their group assignment. The duration and amount of postoperative drainage, as well as the occurrence of seromas were recorded. Outcomes were compared by one-way analysis of variance and chi-square tests. Baseline patient data, including age, body mass index, history of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, type of surgery, number of resected lymph nodes, and number of positive metastases did not differ among the three groups. Patients in both the STG and the Avitene treatment group experienced significantly <outcome>fewer days of drainage</outcome> than those in the CG; there was no significant <outcome>difference in drainage tube retention time</outcome> between the two treated groups. The STG experienced significantly <outcome>less drainage volume</outcome> than the CG. Fewer patients in both treatment groups <outcome>required seroma treatment or experienced complications</outcome> compared with CG patients. Both Sapylin and Avitene effectively reduced postoperative subcutaneous fluid accumulation after axillary lymphadenectomy. These treatments may be particularly useful for breast cancer patients at high risk of seroma formation, especially those with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or a high body mass index who undergo axillary lymphadenectomy.
