Dose-Response Effects of <intervention>Acute Aerobic Exercise Duration</intervention> on Cognitive Function in <eligibility>Patients With Breast Cancer</eligibility>: A Randomized Crossover Trial. To examine the differential effects of acute exercise duration on domains of executive function and processing speed in patients with breast cancer. Participants (N = <No-of-participants>48</No-of-participants>, <average-age>Mage = 56.02 Â± 10.99</average-age>) completed two sessions in counterbalanced order: moderate-intensity treadmill walking and sitting. Participants were also randomized to one of three duration conditions: 10 (n = <intervention-participants>15</intervention-participants>), 20 (n = <intervention-participants>16</intervention-participants>), or 30 (n = <intervention-participants>17</intervention-participants>) min, reflecting the length of time spent walking and sitting. Immediately before and after each session, women completed a battery of cognitive tasks (e.g., inhibition, cognitive flexibility, spatial working memory, and processing speed). Within- and between-subjects repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed time by condition interactions on both processing speed (p = 0.02) and <outcome>spatial working memory</outcome> (ps &lt; 0.07), such that women demonstrated improved cognitive functioning regardless of the time spent walking. There were also several moderately sized three-way (e.g., time by condition by duration) interactions driven by <outcome>declines in cognitive functioning</outcome> after sitting on cognitive flexibility in the 10 (d = -0.96) and 30-min (d = -0.52) groups and inhibition in the 20-min group (d = 0.75). On the processing speed task, women <outcome>performed significantly faster after walking</outcome> compared with after sitting in the 20-min group (d = -0.24). For select cognitive domains, walking anywhere from 10 to 30 min is associated with significant benefits. Our findings suggest the need for further research into the mechanisms and dose-response relationships between acute exercise and cognition as well as how such acute bouts may be accumulated for larger, lasting cognitive benefits after breast cancer. www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04255225.
