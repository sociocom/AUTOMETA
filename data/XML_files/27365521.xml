Evaluation of oral care to prevent <condition>oral mucositis</condition> in <eligibility>estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer patients treated with everolimus (Oral Care-BC)</eligibility>: randomized controlled phase III trial. This is a randomized, multi-center, open-label, phase III study to evaluate the efficacy of <intervention>professional oral care</intervention> in preventing oral mucositis induced by everolimus in <eligibility>postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer</eligibility>. Patients will be randomized into professional oral care and <control>control</control> groups (1:1 ratio). All patients will receive everolimus with exemestane and will continue everolimus until disease progression. In the professional oral care group, patients will receive teeth surface cleaning, scaling and tongue cleaning before starting everolimus, and will continue to receive professional oral care weekly from oral surgeons throughout the <duration>8 week</duration> treatment. In the control group, patients will brush their own teeth and gargle with 0.9% sodium chloride solution or water. The primary endpoint is the <outcome-Measure>incidence of all grades of oral mucositis</outcome-Measure>. Target accrual is <No-of-participants>200</No-of-participants> patients with a two-sided type I error rate of 5% and 80% power to detect 25% risk reduction.
