The Effects of a <intervention>Remote-based Weight Loss Program</intervention> on Adipocytokines, Metabolic Markers, and Telomere Length in Breast Cancer Survivors: the POWER-Remote Trial. We initiated a clinical trial to determine the proportion of breast cancer survivors achieving ≥5% weight loss using a remotely delivered weight loss intervention (POWER-remote) or a self-directed approach, and to determine the effects of the intervention on biomarkers of cancer risk including metabolism, inflammation, and telomere length. <eligibility>Women with stage 0-III breast cancer, who completed local therapy and chemotherapy, with a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2</eligibility> were randomized to a <duration>12-month</duration> intervention (POWER-remote) versus a <control>self-directed approach</control>. The primary objective was to determine the <outcome-Measure>number of women who achieved at least 5% weight loss at 6 months</outcome-Measure>. We assessed baseline and 6-month change in a panel of adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin, resistin, HGF, NGF, PAI1, TNFα, MCP1, IL1β, IL6, and IL8), metabolic factors (insulin, glucose, lipids, hs-CRP), and telomere length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. <duration>From 2013 to 2015</duration>, <No-of-participants>96</No-of-participants> women were enrolled, and <No-of-participants>87</No-of-participants> were evaluable for the primary analysis; <intervention-participants>45</intervention-participants> to POWER-remote and <control-participants>42</control-participants> to self-directed. <outcome>At 6 months</outcome>, <intervention-value>51%</intervention-value> of women randomized to POWER-remote <outcome>lost ≥5% of their baseline body weight</outcome>, compared with <control-value>12%</control-value> in the self-directed arm [OR, 7.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.6-23.9; P = 0.0003]; proportion were similar at <outcome>12 months</outcome> (<intervention-value>51%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>17%</control-value>, respectively, P = 0.003). Weight loss correlated with significant decreases in leptin, and favorable modulation of inflammatory cytokines and lipid profiles. There was no significant change in telomere length at 6 months. A remotely delivered weight loss intervention resulted in significant weight loss in breast cancer survivors, and favorable effects on several biomarkers.
