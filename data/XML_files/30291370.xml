<intervention>Topical atorvastatin</intervention> 1% for prevention of <condition>skin toxicity</condition> in <eligibility>patients receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer</eligibility>: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The purpose of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was to investigate the preventive effect of topical administration of atorvastatin (ATV) on the acute radiation-induced skin toxicity in patients with breast cancer. <No-of-participants>Seventy</No-of-participants> breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to use topical ATV 1% or <control>placebo gels</control> during radiotherapy twice daily. <outcome-Measure>Radiation-induced dermatitis</outcome-Measure> was classified according to the radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) criteria, as well as <outcome-Measure>pain and itching</outcome-Measure> were scored according to VAS (visual analogue scale) for 6Â weeks of treatment. Topical administration of ATV gel during radiotherapy <outcome>reduced significantly radiation-induced breast swelling, itching, and pain</outcome> in breast cancer patients by factors of 1.8, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively. ATV <outcome>reduced the redness caused by radiotherapy</outcome> in patients as compared with placebo; however, this difference was statistically not significant. ATV was able to reduce significantly itching, breast edema, and pain in patients during radiotherapy.
