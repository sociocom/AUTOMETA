A randomized clinical trial of a <control>supportive</control> versus a <intervention>skill-based couple-focused group intervention</intervention> for breast cancer patients. The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of the 2 types of couple-focused group interventions on couples' psychological and relationship functioning, and to examine possible moderators for each intervention. <No-of-participants>Three hundred and two</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with early stage breast cancer who were recruited within 1 year of diagnosis and their spouses</eligibility> were randomly assigned to either an 8 session enhanced couple-focused group intervention (ECG) or a couples' support group (SG). Couples completed surveys at 4 time points: preintervention, 1 week postgroup, 6 months, and 1 year. Analyses indicated that <outcome>anxiety, depressive symptoms, and cancer-specific distress declined and positive well-being improved</outcome> for couples enrolled in both ECG and SG. Thus, neither treatment was superior in terms of reduction of distress or improvements in positive well-being. Moderator effects indicated that, among patients reporting higher <outcome>levels of cancer-specific preintervention distress, anxiety, depression, and well-being</outcome> over the 1-year postintervention time period were significantly lower among SG couples than ECG couples. When patient cancer-specific preintervention distress was low, these 3 outcomes were more positive in ECG relative to SG. A similar pattern with regard to anxiety was illustrated when the moderator effects for perceived partner unsupportive behavior was examined, and a similar pattern was seen for anxiety and well-being for preintervention marital satisfaction. A couple-focused supportive group therapy may be more effective for distressed patients, whereas a structured, skills-based couples' group therapy may be more effective for less distressed patients.
