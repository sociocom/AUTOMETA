[Prevention and treatment of <condition>aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss</condition> by <intervention>shugan jiangu recipe</intervention> in <eligibility>postmenopausal women with breast cancer</eligibility>: a clinical study]. To study the effect of Shugan Jiangu Recipe (SJR) on bone mineral density (BMD) and serum bone metabolic biochemical markers in postmenopausal breast cancer patients with osteopenia. Totally <No-of-participants>38</No-of-participants> <eligibility>patients of postmenopausal women with breast cancer, who received aromatase inhibitors (AIs)</eligibility>, were assigned to the treatment group (<intervention-participants>21</intervention-participants> cases) and the <control-participants>control group</control-participants> (<control-participants>17</control-participants> cases) by using random digit table. All patients took Caltrate D Tablet (containing Ca 600 mg and Vit D3 125 IU), one tablet daily. Patients in the treatment group took SJR, 6 g each time, twice daily for <duration>6 successive months</duration>. The <outcome-Measure>bone mineral density (BMD) level</outcome-Measure> was detected before treatment and at months 6 after treatment. <outcome-Measure>Levels of bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>bone gla protein (BGP)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II)</outcome-Measure> were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The drug safety was also assessed. Compared with before treatment, BMD of L2-4 and femur neck obviously increased in the treatment group at month 6 after treatment (P &lt;0.01), <outcome>serum BALP and TRAP</outcome> decreased (P &lt;0.05). Compared with before treatment, <outcome>BMD of L2-4 and femur neck</outcome> obviously decreased in the control group at month 6 after treatment (P &lt;0.05), <outcome>serum BALP and TRAP</outcome> increased (P &lt;0.01). Compared with the control group, <outcome>lumbar and femur neck BMD</outcome> obviously increased, <outcome>serum levels of BGP and BALP</outcome> obviously decreased, and <outcome>serum levels of CTX-II and TRAP</outcome> obviously increased in the treatment group at month 6 after treatment (P &lt;0.01). <outcome>No serious adverse event</outcome> occurred during the treatment period. <outcome>Bone fracture</outcome> occurred in <control-value>one</control-value> case of the control group (<control-value>5.8%</control-value>). SJR could attenuate bone loss of postmenopausal women with breast cancer who received AIs, increase BMD and improve abnormal bone metabolism.
