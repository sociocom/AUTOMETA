Effect of <intervention>tamoxifen</intervention> on <condition>venous thromboembolic events</condition> in a breast cancer prevention trial. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, increases venous thromboembolic events (VTE), but the factors explaining this risk are unclear. Atherosclerosis may induce VTE, or the 2 conditions may share common risk factors. We assessed the effect of tamoxifen on VTE in a breast cancer prevention trial and studied its association with risk factors for VTE. The <outcome-Measure>incidence of VTE</outcome-Measure> was studied in <No-of-participants>5408</No-of-participants> <eligibility>hysterectomized women</eligibility> randomly assigned to tamoxifen 20 mg/d or <control>placebo</control> for <duration>5 years</duration>. There were <control-value>28</control-value> <outcome>VTEs</outcome> on placebo and <intervention-value>44</intervention-value> on tamoxifen therapy (hazard ratio [HR]=1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.63), 80% of which were superficial phlebitis, accounting for all of the excess due to tamoxifen within 18 months from randomization. Compared with placebo, the <outcome>risk of VTE on tamoxifen</outcome> was higher in women aged 55 years or older, women with a body mass index > or =25 kg/m2, elevated blood pressure, total cholesterol > or =250 mg/dL, current smoking, and a family history of coronary heart disease (CHD). Of the 685 women with a CHD risk score > or =5 who entered the trial, <control-value>1</control-value> in the placebo arm and <intervention-value>13</intervention-value> in the tamoxifen arm <outcome>developed VTE</outcome> (log-rank P=0.0013). In multivariate regression analysis, age > or =60 years, height > or =165 cm, and diastolic blood pressure > or =90 mm Hg had independent detrimental effects on VTE risk during tamoxifen therapy, whereas transdermal estrogen therapy concomitant with tamoxifen was not associated with any excess of VTE (HR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.23 to 1.82). Women with conventional risk factors for atherosclerosis have a higher risk of VTE during tamoxifen therapy. This information should be incorporated into counseling women on its risk-benefit ratio, particularly in the prevention setting.
