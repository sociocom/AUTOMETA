No differences between <intervention>Calendula cream</intervention> and <control>aqueous cream</control> in the prevention of <condition>acute radiation skin reactions</condition>--results from a randomised blinded trial. The purpose of this blinded, randomized clinical trial was to compare two topical agents (<intervention>Calendula Weleda cream</intervention> vs. <intervention>Essex cream</intervention>) in reducing the risk of severe acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) in relation to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for breast cancer. The primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>difference in proportion of patients with ARSR</outcome-Measure>, assessed with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/The Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (RTOG/EORTC scale) at follow-up. The secondary endpoints included <outcome-Measure>patient reported outcome measures</outcome-Measure>; <outcome-Measure>Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>Sleep disturbances (MOS-sleep questionnaire)</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>symptoms from the irradiated area (visual analogue scale)</outcome-Measure>. Patients' experiences and adherence to the topical agents were also evaluated. A total of <No-of-participants>420</No-of-participants> patients were randomised and <No-of-participants>411</No-of-participants> were analysed. With the exception of previous chemotherapy, the treatment groups were well balanced, both regarding treatment- and patient-related factors. The <outcome>incidence of severe ARSR (RTOG/EORTC grade â‰¤2)</outcome> at the follow-up visit was <intervention-value>23%</intervention-value> (n = <intervention-participants>45</intervention-participants>) in the Calendula group and <control-value>19%</control-value> (n = <control-participants>38</control-participants>) in the Essex group. We found no difference in severe ARSR between the groups at any point of assessment. The patients reported low <outcome>levels of skin related symptoms</outcome> and no statistically significant differences between the groups were found. No differences in ARSR between patients randomised to Calendula or Essex cream was found. ARSR seem to be a relatively limited problem, probably more influenced by treatment related factors than by choice of skin care products in this patient group.
