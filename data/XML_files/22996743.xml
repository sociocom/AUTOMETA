<intervention>Impact + resistance training</intervention> improves bone health and body composition in <eligibility>prematurely menopausal breast cancer survivors</eligibility>: a randomized controlled trial. Our randomized controlled trial in prematurely menopausal breast cancer survivors showed that impact + resistance training prevented increases in percentage of body fat compared with controls and also improved BMD at the hip and prevented BMD loss at the spine among exercise-trained women who were menopausal for >1 year. Cancer treatment-related menopause worsens bone health and body composition in breast cancer survivors (BCS). We investigated whether impact + resistance training could improve bone mineral density (BMD), reduce bone turnover, build muscle, and decrease fat mass in BCS with premature menopause. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in <No-of-participants>71</No-of-participants> BCS (mean age, <average-age>46.5 years</average-age>) within 5 years of treatment-related menopause. Women were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) impact + resistance training (prevent osteoporosis with impact + resistance (POWIR)) or (2) <control>exercise placebo</control> (FLEX) 3×/week for <duration>1 year</duration>. Outcomes were <outcome-Measure>hip and spine BMD</outcome-Measure> (in grams per square centimeter) and <outcome-Measure>body composition</outcome-Measure> (percent body fat (%BF) and <outcome-Measure>lean and fat mass</outcome-Measure> (in kilograms)) by DXA and <outcome-Measure>bone turnover markers</outcome-Measure> (serum osteocalcin (in nanograms per milliliter) and <outcome-Measure>urinary deoxypryrodinoline</outcome-Measure> (in nanomoles per milliliter). There were <outcome>no significant group × time interactions for bone outcomes</outcome> when using an intent-to-treat approach on the full sample. In analyses restricted to BCS who were menopausal for ≥1 year, <outcome>POWIR increased BMD at the hip and slowed BMD loss at the spine</outcome> compared with FLEX (femoral neck-POWIR, 0.004 ± 0.093 g/cm(2) vs. FLEX, -0.010 ± 0.089 g/cm(2); p &lt; 0.01; spine-POWIR, -0.003 ± 0.114 g/cm(2) vs. FLEX, -0.020 ± 0.110 g/cm(2); p = 0.03). POWIR prevented <outcome>increases in %BF</outcome> (POWIR, 0.01 % vs. FLEX, 1.3 %; p &lt; 0.04). Women with attendance to POWIR at ≥64 % had better <outcome>improvements in %BF</outcome> than women attending less often (p &lt; 0.03). Impact + resistance training may effectively combat bone loss and worsening body composition from premature menopause in BCS.
