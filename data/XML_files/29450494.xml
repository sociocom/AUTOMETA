Comparison of the Performance of 6 <intervention>Prognostic Signatures</intervention> for Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial. Multiple molecular signatures are available for managing estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer but with little direct comparative information to guide the patient's choice. To conduct a within-patient comparison of the prognostic value of 6 multigene signatures in <eligibility>women with early ER-positive breast cancer who received endocrine therapy for 5 years</eligibility>. This retrospective biomarker analysis included <No-of-participants>774</No-of-participants> <eligibility>postmenopausal women with ER-positive ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative breast cancer</eligibility>. This analysis was performed as a preplanned secondary study of data from the Anastrozole or Tamoxifen Alone or Combined randomized clinical trial comparing 5-year treatment with anastrozole vs tamoxifen with 10-year follow-up data. The signatures included the Oncotype Dx recurrence score, PAM50-based Prosigna risk of recurrence (ROR), Breast Cancer Index (BCI), EndoPredict (EPclin), Clinical Treatment Score, and 4-marker immunohistochemical score. Data were collected <duration>from January 2009, through April 2015</duration>. The primary objective was to <outcome-Measure>compare the prognostic value of these signatures in addition to the Clinical Treatment Score (nodal status, tumor size, grade, age, and endocrine treatment) for distant recurrence for 0 to 10 years and 5 to 10 years after diagnosis</outcome-Measure>. Likelihood ratio (LR) statistics were used with the χ2 test and C indexes to assess the prognostic value of each signature. In this study of <No-of-participants>774</No-of-participants> postmenopausal women with ER-positive, ERBB2-negative disease (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [8.1] years), 591 (mean [SD] age, 63.4 [7.9] years) had node-negative disease. The signatures providing the most prognostic information were the <outcome>ROR</outcome> (hazard ratio [HR], 2.56; 95% CI, 1.96-3.35), followed by the <outcome>BCI</outcome> (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.88-3.23) and <outcome>EPclin</outcome> (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.71-2.68). Each provided significantly more information than the Clinical Treatment Score (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.58-2.50), the <outcome>recurrence score</outcome> (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.40-2.03), and the <outcome>4-marker immunohistochemical score</outcome> (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.55-2.45). Substantially less information was provided by all 6 molecular tests for the 183 patients with 1 to 3 positive nodes, but the BCI (ΔLR χ2 = 9.2) and EPclin (ΔLR χ2 = 7.4) provided more additional prognostic information than the other signatures. For women with node-negative disease, the ROR, BCI, and EPclin were significantly more prognostic for overall and late distant recurrence. For women with 1 to 3 positive nodes, limited independent information was available from any test. These data might help oncologists and patients to choose the most appropriate test when considering chemotherapy use and/or extended endocrine therapy. isrctn.com Identifier: ISRCTN18233230.
