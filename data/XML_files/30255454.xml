COOLHAIR: a prospective randomized trial to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of <intervention>scalp cooling</intervention> in <eligibility>patients undergoing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer</eligibility>. <condition>Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA)</condition> is a distressing side effect for women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Scalp cooling is a method aiming to prevent CIA, but its efficacy is not well defined. Randomized trials until recently and at the time this trial was designed have been lacking. <eligibility>Patients undergoing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer (EBC)</eligibility> were randomized to scalp cooling (CAP) or <control>observation (NoCAP)</control>. All patients received <duration>18-24 weeks</duration> of anthracycline- and/or taxane-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>patient-reported rate of alopecia according to a modified version of the Dean Scale</outcome-Measure>. Hair preservation was defined as hair loss ≤ grade 2 (≤ 50%). Secondary endpoints were <outcome-Measure>rate of alopecia determined by medical staff</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>rate of wig/scarf use</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>tolerability</outcome-Measure> as well as <outcome-Measure>quality of life (QoL)</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>Seventy-nine</No-of-participants> patients were randomized. <outcome>Hair preservation</outcome> was observed in <intervention-value>39.3%</intervention-value> of patients in the CAP arm versus <control-value>0%</control-value> in the NoCAP arm (p &lt; 0.001). <outcome>Wig/scarf use</outcome> was significantly less frequent in the CAP group (<intervention-value>40.7%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>95.5%</control-value> outside home before cycle 3, p &lt; 0.001). The <outcome>drop-out rate</outcome> was <intervention-value>31.7%</intervention-value> and <control-value>34.2%</control-value> in the CAP and NoCAP arm, respectively. Main reasons for drop-out were hair loss, adverse events (CAP), and randomization into control arm. We observed no differences in efficacy between anthracycline-based and non-anthracycline-based regimens. QoL did not differ between the study arms. This trial adds to the evidence that scalp cooling effectively prevents CIA in a meaningful number of patients. This option should be made available for patients undergoing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for EBC.
