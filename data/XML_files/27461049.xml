Long-term <intervention>Diet</intervention> and Biomarker Changes after a Short-term Intervention among <ethinicity>Hispanic</ethinicity> Breast Cancer Survivors: The ¡Cocinar Para Su Salud! Randomized Controlled Trial. Among Hispanic breast cancer survivors, we examined the long-term effects of a short-term culturally based dietary intervention on increasing fruits/vegetables (F/V), decreasing fat, and changing biomarkers associated with breast cancer recurrence risk. <eligibility>Spanish-speaking women</eligibility> (n = <No-of-participants>70</No-of-participants>) <eligibility>with a history of stage 0-III breast cancer who completed treatment</eligibility> were randomized to ¡Cocinar Para Su Salud! (n = <intervention-participants>34</intervention-participants>), a culturally based 9-session program (24 hours over 12 weeks, including nutrition education, cooking classes, and food-shopping field trips), or a <control>control</control> group (n = <control-participants>36</control-participants>, written dietary recommendations for breast cancer survivors). <outcome-Measure>Diet recalls</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>fasting blood</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>anthropometric measures</outcome-Measure> were collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months. We report <outcome-Measure>changes between groups at 12 months in dietary intake and biomarkers</outcome-Measure> using 2-sample Wilcoxon t tests and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. At 12 months, the intervention group compared with the control group reported higher <outcome>increases in mean daily F/V servings</outcome> (total: +2.0 vs. -0.4; P &lt;0.01), and nonsignificant <outcome>decreases in the percentage of calories from fat</outcome> (-2.2% vs. -1.1%; P = 0.69) and weight (-2.6 kg vs. -1.5 kg; P = 0.56). Compared with controls, participants in the intervention group had higher <outcome>increases in plasma lutein</outcome> (+20.4% vs. -11.5%; P &lt;0.01), and borderline significant <outcome>increases in global DNA methylation</outcome> (+0.8% vs. -0.5%; P = 0.06). The short-term ¡Cocinar Para Su Salud! program was effective at increasing long-term F/V intake in Hispanic breast cancer survivors and changed biomarkers associated with breast cancer recurrence risk. It is possible for short-term behavioral interventions to have long-term effects on behaviors and biomarkers in minority cancer patient populations. Results can inform future study designs.
