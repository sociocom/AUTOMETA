Evaluation of <intervention>lecithinized human recombinant super oxide dismutase</intervention> as cardioprotectant in anthracycline-treated breast cancer patients. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is (partly) mediated by free radical overload. A randomized study was performed in breast cancer patients to investigate whether free radical scavenger super oxide dismutase (SOD) protects against <condition>anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity</condition> as measured by changes in echo, electrocardiography and an array of biomarkers. <No-of-participants>Eighty</No-of-participants> <eligibility>female, chemotherapy-naïve breast cancer patients</eligibility> (median age <average-age>49</average-age>, range 24-67 years) scheduled for four or five courses of adjuvant 3 weekly doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to receive 80 mg PC-SOD (human recombinant SOD bound to lecithin) or <control>placebo</control>, administered intravenously (i.v.) immediately prior to each AC course. The primary end point was p&lt;utcome-Measure>rotection against cardiac damage</outcome-Measure> evaluated using echocardiography, QT assessments and a set of biochemical markers for myocardial function, oxidative stress and inflammation. Assessments were performed before and during each course of chemotherapy, and at 1, 4 and 9 months after completion of the chemotherapy regimen. In all patients cardiac effects such as increases in <outcome>NT-proBNP concentration and prolongation of the QTc interval</outcome> were noticed. There were no differences between the PC-SOD and placebo-treated patients in <outcome>systolic or diastolic cardiac function</outcome> or for any other of the biomarkers used to assess the cardiac effects of anthracyclines. PC-SOD at a dose of 80 mg i.v. is not cardioprotective in patients with breast carcinoma treated with anthracyclines.
