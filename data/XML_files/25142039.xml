Prevention of <condition>post-mastectomy neuropathic pain</condition> with <intervention>memantine</intervention>: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists are potential therapies for neuropathic pain, and memantine has a good tolerance profile. A preclinical study recently reported that presurgery memantine may prevent neuropathic pain development and cognition dysfunction. Considering the high prevalence of breast cancer and of post-mastectomy neuropathic pain, a clinical trial is carried out to evaluate if memantine may prevent neuropathic pain development and maintain cognitive function and quality of life in cancer patients. A randomized clinical trial (NCT01536314) includes <No-of-participants>40</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy</eligibility> at the Oncology Hospital, <location>Clermont-Ferrand, France</location>. Memantine (5 to 20 mg/day; n = <intervention-participants>20</intervention-participants>) or <control>placebo</control> (n = <control-participants>20</control-participants>) is administered for <duration>4 weeks</duration> starting 2 weeks before surgery. Intensity of pain, cognitive function, quality of life and of sleep, anxiety and depression are evaluated with questionnaires. The primary endpoint is <outcome-Measure>pain intensity</outcome-Measure> on a 0 to 10) numerical scale at 3 months post-mastectomy. Data analysis is performed using mixed models and the tests are two-sided, with a type I error set at α = 0.05. The hypothesis of this translational approach is to confirm in patients the beneficial prophylactic effect of memantine observed in animals. Such a protective action of memantine against neuropathic pain and cognitive dysfunction would greatly improve the quality of life of cancer patients.
