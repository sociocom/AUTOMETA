A randomized study of <intervention>olanzapine</intervention>-containing versus standard antiemetic regimens for the prevention of <condition>chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</condition> in <ethinicity>Chinese</ethinicity> breast cancer patients. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are distressing symptoms. This randomized study evaluated the antiemetic efficacies of standard antiemetic regimen with/without olanzapine. Eligible patients were <eligibility>chemotherapy-naive Chinese breast cancer patients who were planned for (neo)adjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide</eligibility>. Antiemetic regimen for all studied population included aprepitant, ondansetron and dexamethasone; patients were randomized to Olanzapine (with olanzapine) or <control>Standard arms (without olanzapine)</control>. <outcome-Measure>Patients filled in self-reported diaries and completed visual analogue scales for nausea, as well as Functional Living Index-Emesis questionnaires</outcome-Measure>. <outcome-Measure>Blood profiles including fasting glucose and lipids</outcome-Measure> were monitored. <No-of-participants>120</No-of-participants> patients were randomized. In Cycle 1 doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, the Olanzapine arm had significantly higher <outcome>rates of "Complete Response"</outcome> than the Standard arm: <intervention-value>65.0%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>38.3%</control-value> <outcome>in the overall period</outcome> (p = 0.0035), <intervention-value>70.0%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>51.7%</control-value> <outcome>in the acute period</outcome> (p = 0.0397) and <intervention-value>92.9%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>74.2%</control-value> <outcome>in the delayed period</outcome> (p = 0.0254). Olanzapine arm also had significantly higher <outcome>rates of "No significant nausea" and "No nausea"</outcome> during all 3 time-frames and better QOL. Similar findings were also revealed throughout multiple cycles. Pre-study <outcome>abnormalities in glucose and lipids</outcome> occurred in 39.7% and 34.2% of the studied population respectively; there were no differences in these parameters between the two arms at end-of-study assessment. The addition of olanzapine to standard aprepitant-based antiemetic regimen provides clinically meaningful improvement in controlling CINV. This was associated with a positive impact on QOL and tolerable toxicity profiles among Chinese breast cancer patients receiving doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Further studies on metabolic profiles of breast cancer patients are warranted.
