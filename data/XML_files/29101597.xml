Randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial of <intervention>omega 3 fatty acids</intervention> for prevention of <condition>aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal pain</condition>. Aromatase inhibitor (AI)-induced joint symptoms negatively impact drug adherence and quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Mechanisms underlying symptoms may include inflammation. It is hypothesized that n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have anti-inflammatory properties and may reduce symptoms. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing 4.3 g/day n - 3 PUFA supplements vs <control>placebo</control> for <duration>24 weeks</duration> in <eligibility>postmenopausal breast cancer patients starting adjuvant AIs</eligibility>. Primary endpoints were <outcome-Measure>adherence and tolerability</outcome-Measure>; secondary outcomes included <outcome-Measure>inflammatory cytokines and symptoms</outcome-Measure> assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory short form (BPI-SF) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) at 0, 12, and 24 weeks. <No-of-participants>Forty-four</No-of-participants> women were randomized, of which <No-of-participants>35</No-of-participants> completed the study. <outcome>Adherence</outcome> was ≥ 88% based on these 35 patients with pill counts as well as change in red blood cell (RBC) n - 3 PUFAs. Common toxicities included <outcome>grade 1 flatulence</outcome> (<intervention-value>55%</intervention-value> of both groups) and <outcome>belching</outcome> (<intervention-value>45%</intervention-value> of n - 3 group). <outcome>Mean pain severity scores (BPI-SF)</outcome> did not change significantly by time or treatment arm. <outcome>Quality of life, based on FACT-ES scores</outcome>, significantly decreased within placebo (p = 0.04), but not the n - 3 group (p = 0.58), with a trend toward between-group differences (p = 0.06) at 12 weeks, but no significant differences at 24 weeks. <outcome>RBC n - 3 levels</outcome> were strongly positively correlated with FACT-ES at 12 weeks, but attenuated at 24 weeks. High-dose n - 3 PUFA supplementation is feasible and well tolerated when administered with AIs. Additional studies are needed to evaluate efficacy in prevention of joint symptoms.
