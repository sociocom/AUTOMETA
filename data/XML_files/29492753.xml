Use of a <intervention>web-based app</intervention> to improve breast cancer symptom management and adherence for aromatase inhibitors: a randomized controlled feasibility trial. For postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, long-term use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) significantly reduces the risk of cancer recurrence and improves survival. Still, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the use of a web-based application (app) designed with and without weekly reminders for patients to report real-time symptoms and AI use outside of clinic visits with built-in alerts to patients' oncology providers. Our goal was to improve symptom burden and medication adherence. <No-of-participants>Forty-four</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with early-stage breast cancer and a new AI prescription</eligibility> were randomized to either an App+Reminder (weekly reminders to use app) or an <control>App (no reminders) group</control>. Pre- and post-assessment data were collected from all participants. Participants in the App+Reminder group had higher <outcome>weekly app usage rate</outcome> (<intervention-value>74</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>38%</control-value>, p &lt; 0.05) during the intervention and reported higher <outcome>AI adherence</outcome> at 8Â weeks (<intervention-value>100</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>72%</control-value>, p &lt; 0.05). <outcome>Symptom burden increase</outcome> was higher for the App group compared to the App+Reminder group but did not reach statistical significance. Weekly reminders to use a web-based app to report AI adherence and treatment-related symptoms demonstrated feasibility and improved short-term AI adherence, which may reduce symptom burden for women with breast cancer and a new AI prescription. If short-term gains in adherence persist, this low-cost intervention could improve survival outcomes for women with breast cancer. A larger, long-term study should examine if AI adherence and symptom burden improvements persist for a 5-year treatment period.
