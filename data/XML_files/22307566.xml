<intervention>Soy isoflavone</intervention> supplementation for breast cancer risk reduction: a randomized phase II trial. Soy isoflavone consumption may protect against breast cancer development. We conducted a phase IIB trial of soy isoflavone supplementation to examine its effect on breast epithelial proliferation and other biomarkers in the healthy high-risk breast. <No-of-participants>One hundred and twenty-six</No-of-participants> consented women underwent a random fine-needle aspiration (rFNA); those with 4,000 or more epithelial cells were randomized to a double-blind 6-month intervention of mixed soy isoflavones (PTIG-2535) or <control>placebo</control>, followed by repeat rFNA. Cells were examined for <outcome-Measure>Ki-67 labeling index</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>atypia</outcome-Measure>. <outcome-Measure>Expression of 28 genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, and estrogenic effect</outcome-Measure> was measured using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. <outcome-Measure>Hormone and protein levels</outcome-Measure> were measured in nipple aspirate fluid (NAF). All statistical tests were two-sided. <No-of-participants>Ninety-eight</No-of-participants> women were evaluable for Ki-67 labeling index. In <intervention-participants>49</intervention-participants> treated women, the <outcome>median Ki-67 labeling index</outcome> was 1.18 at entry and 1.12 post intervention, whereas in <control-participants>49</control-participants> placebo subjects, it was 0.97 and 0.92 (P for between-group change: 0.32). <outcome>Menopausal stratification</outcome> yielded similar results between groups, but within premenopausal soy-treated women, <outcome>Ki-67 labeling index</outcome> increased from 1.71 to 2.18 (P = 0.04). We saw no treatment effect on <outcome>cytologic atypia or NAF parameters</outcome>. There were significant increases in the <outcome>expression of 14 of 28 genes</outcome> within the soy, but not the control group, without significant between-group differences. <outcome>Plasma genistein values</outcome> showed excellent compliance. A 6-month intervention of mixed soy isoflavones in healthy, high-risk adult Western women did not reduce breast epithelial proliferation, suggesting a lack of efficacy for breast cancer prevention and a possible adverse effect in premenopausal women.
