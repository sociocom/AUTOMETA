A pilot randomized clinical study of the additive treatment effect of <intervention>photodynamic therapy</intervention> in breast cancer patients with <condition>chest wall recurrence</condition>. This study investigated the additive effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) plus traditional radiotherapy (RT) for patients with breast cancer and chest wall recurrence. A total of <No-of-participants>40</No-of-participants> patients with recurrent breast cancer were prospectively randomized to receive <control>RT alone</control> (group A, n=<control-participants>20</control-participants>) or PDT and RT in combination (group B, n=<intervention-participants>20</intervention-participants>). Traditional RT at a dose of 50 Gy was delivered in 25 fractions with or without exposure to 5-aminolevulinic acid and red light as PDT. The <outcome>response rates</outcome> were not statistically different between the groups, but more patients achieved a complete response (CR) in group B (<intervention-value>50%</intervention-value>) than in group A (<control-value>20%</control-value>). The <outcome>median time to CR</outcome> in group B was significantly shorter than that in group A (109.6 days vs. 175.2 days, p=0.001). <outcome>Adverse event profiles</outcome> were not different between the groups. An additive antitumor effect is demonstrated with additional PDT to RT. This combination therapy might reduce the duration of exposure to RT, but further investigation is warranted.
