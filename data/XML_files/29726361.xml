A Randomized Trial of <intervention>Mometasone Furoate</intervention> 0.1% to Reduce High-Grade <condition>Acute Radiation Dermatitis</condition> in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Postmastectomy Radiation. A 2-arm, double-blinded randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 0.1% mometasone furoate (MF) versus <control>Eucerin Original (E)</control> cream in preventing the development of moderate to severe acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) in breast cancer patients receiving postmastectomy radiation (PMRT). <eligibility>Breast cancer patients undergoing chest wall with or without nodal radiation therapy</eligibility> (RT) (50 Gy) were eligible. Randomization (1:1) was to MF or E, applied twice daily from day 1 of PMRT to 14 days after PMRT. Patients were stratified by RT technique, body mass index, and reconstruction status. Daily bolus of 3 to 10 mm was applied in all patients. The primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>development of provider-assessed grade ≥2 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03) ARD with moist desquamation</outcome-Measure> or <outcome-Measure>any grade ≥3 dermatitis</outcome-Measure>. Secondary endpoints were <outcome-Measure>time to occurrence of maximum-grade dermatitis</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>patient-reported skin symptoms</outcome-Measure> using a skin-related quality of life questionnaire, Skindex-16. Assessments were performed at baseline, weekly during PMRT, and 2 weeks after PMRT. <No-of-participants>124</No-of-participants> patients were enrolled <duration>between May 2013 and February 2016</duration>. Of those, 35% had pathologic stage III disease, 6% had cT4d disease, and 68% underwent reconstruction. Sixty percent received 3-dimensional conformal RT with photons only to the chest wall, 18% received electrons and photons, and 23% received inverse-planned intensity modulated RT. Groups were well balanced for age, skin type, and stage. The <outcome>rate of moist desquamation</outcome> was 54.8% in the entire cohort, with a significantly reduced incidence in the MF arm than in the E arm (<intervention-value>43.8%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>66.7%</control-value>; P = .012). The MF arm had a lower <outcome>incidence of maximum skin toxicities</outcome> (P = .036) and longer <outcome>time to development of grade 3 dermatitis</outcome> (46 days vs 35.5 days, respectively; P ≤ .001). There was no difference in <outcome>patient-reported skin outcomes</outcome> between arms. Breast cancer patients receiving MF during PMRT experienced significantly reduced rates of moist desquamation in comparison with a control cream.
