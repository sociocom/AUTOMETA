A randomized controlled trial on the effect of a <intervention>silver carboxymethylcellulose dressing</intervention> on <condition>surgical site infections</condition> after breast cancer surgery. The incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) after breast cancer surgery is relatively high; ranging from 3 to 19%. The role of wound dressings in the prevention of SSI after breast cancer surgery is unclear. This study compares a silver carboxymethylcellulose dressing (AQUACEL Ag Surgical (Aquacel) with standard wound dressing in SSI rate after breast cancer surgery. A single-centre randomized controlled trial among women <average-age>≥18 years</average-age>, <eligibility>diagnosed with breast cancer, undergoing breast conserving or ablative surgery</eligibility>, was conducted in a combined in and outpatient setting. The intervention was the use of Aquacel, compared with standard gauze dressing. Primary outcome measure was <outcome-Measure>SSI following CDC criteria</outcome-Measure>. A total of <No-of-participants>230</No-of-participants> patients were analysed: <intervention-participants>106</intervention-participants> in the Aquacel group and <control-participants>124</control-participants> <control>controls</control>. <intervention-value>Seven</intervention-value> patients (<intervention-value>6.6%</intervention-value>) <outcome>developed SSI</outcome> in the Aquacel group and <control-value>16</control-value> patients (<control-value>12.9%</control-value>) in the control group (RR 0.51 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.22-1.20]; p = 0.112; adjusted OR 0.49 [0.19-1.25] p = 0.135)). Unplanned exploratory subgroup analysis of breast conserving surgery patients showed that <outcome>SSI rate</outcome> was <intervention-value>1</intervention-value>/<intervention-participants>56</intervention-participants> (<intervention-value>1.8%</intervention-value>) in the Aquacel group vs. <control-value>7</control-value>/<control-participants>65</control-participants> (<control-value>10.8%</control-value>) in controls; adjusted OR 0.15 [0.02-1.31] p = 0.087. The Aquacel group showed better <outcome>patient satisfaction</outcome> (median 8 vs. 7 on a Numerical Rating Scale, p = 0.006), fewer <outcome>dressing changes within 48 hours</outcome>(adjusted OR 0.12 [0.05-0.27] p&lt;.001), fewer <outcome>re-operations</outcome> (<intervention-value>0%</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>3.2%</control-value>, p = 0.062), and lower mean <outcome>wound-related treatment costs</outcome>, both in a high (€265.42 (SD = 908) vs. €470.65 (SD = 1223) [p&lt;.001]) and low (€59.12 (SD = 129) vs. €67.55 (SD = 172) [p&lt;.001]) <outcome>attributable costs of SSI model</outcome>. In this randomized controlled trial in women undergoing surgery for breast cancer, the use of AQUACEL Ag Surgical wound dressing did not significantly reduce the occurrence of SSIs compared to standard gauze dressing. The use of Aquacel resulted in significantly improved patient satisfaction, reduced dressing changes and reduced wound-related costs. www.trialregister.nl: NTR5840.
