Effect of <intervention>Acupuncture</intervention> vs <control>Sham Acupuncture</control> or <control>Waitlist Control</control> on <condition>Joint Pain</condition> Related to Aromatase Inhibitors Among Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Musculoskeletal symptoms are the most common adverse effects of aromatase inhibitors and often result in therapy discontinuation. Small studies suggest that acupuncture may decrease aromatase inhibitor-related joint symptoms. To determine the effect of acupuncture in reducing aromatase inhibitor-related joint pain. Randomized clinical trial conducted at 11 academic centers and clinical sites in the <location>United States</location> <duration>from March 2012 to February 2017</duration> (final date of follow-up, September 5, 2017). Eligible patients were <eligibility>postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer who were taking an aromatase inhibitor and scored at least 3 on the Brief Pain Inventory Worst Pain (BPI-WP) item (score range, 0-10; higher scores indicate greater pain)</eligibility>. Patients were randomized 2:1:1 to the true acupuncture (n = <intervention-participants>110</intervention-participants>), sham acupuncture (n = <control-participants>59</control-participants>), or waitlist control (n = <control-participants>57</control-participants>) group. True acupuncture and sham acupuncture protocols consisted of 12 acupuncture sessions over 6 weeks (2 sessions per week), followed by 1 session per week for 6 weeks. The waitlist control group did not receive any intervention. All participants were offered 10 acupuncture sessions to be used between weeks 24 and 52. The primary end point was the <outcome-Measure>6-week BPI-WP score</outcome-Measure>. Mean 6-week BPI-WP scores were compared by study group using linear regression, adjusted for baseline pain and stratification factors (clinically meaningful difference specified as 2 points). Among <No-of-participants>226</No-of-participants> randomized patients (mean [SD] age, <average-age>60.7 [8.6] years</average-age>; 88% <ethinicity>white</ethinicity>; mean [SD] baseline BPI-WP score, 6.6 [1.5]), <No-of-participants>206</No-of-participants> (91.1%) completed the trial. From baseline to 6 weeks, the <outcome>mean observed BPI-WP score</outcome> decreased by 2.05 points (reduced pain) in the true acupuncture group, by 1.07 points in the sham acupuncture group, and by 0.99 points in the waitlist control group. The <outcome>adjusted difference</outcome> for <outcome>true acupuncture vs sham acupuncture</outcome> was 0.92 points (95% CI, 0.20-1.65; P = .01) and for <outcome>true acupuncture vs waitlist control</outcome> was 0.96 points (95% CI, 0.24-1.67; P = .01). Patients in the true acupuncture group experienced more <outcome>grade 1 bruising</outcome> compared with patients in the sham acupuncture group (<intervention-value>47%</intervention-value> vs <control-value>25%</control-value>; P = .01). Among postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer and aromatase inhibitor-related arthralgias, true acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture or with waitlist control resulted in a statistically significant reduction in joint pain at 6 weeks, although the observed improvement was of uncertain clinical importance.
