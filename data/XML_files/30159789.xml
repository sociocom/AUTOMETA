<intervention>Omega-3 fatty acid</intervention> use for obese breast cancer patients with <condition>aromatase inhibitor-related arthralgia</condition> (SWOG S0927). Although aromatase inhibitors (AIs) prolong survival in post-menopausal breast cancer (BC) patients, AI-associated arthralgia can lead to discontinuation. Obese patients have higher rates of AI arthralgia than non-obese patients, but treatment options are limited. Omega-3 fatty acid (O3-FA) treatment for AI arthralgia has produced mixed results. We performed an exploratory analysis of SWOG S0927, a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of O3-FA use for AI arthralgia. <eligibility>Post-menopausal women with stage I-III BC taking an AI</eligibility> were randomized to <duration>24 weeks</duration> of O3-FAs or <control>placebo</control>. <outcome-Measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaires</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>fasting serum</outcome-Measure> were collected at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks. The BPI assessment included <outcome-Measure>worst pain, average pain, and pain interference scores</outcome-Measure> (range 0-10). Among the <No-of-participants>249</No-of-participants> participants, 139 had BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2 (56%) and 110 had BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (44%). Among obese patients, O3-FA use was associated with significantly lower <outcome>BPI worst pain scores at 24 weeks</outcome> compared with placebo (4.36 vs. 5.70, p = 0.02), whereas among non-obese patients, there was no significant difference in scores between treatment arms (5.27 vs. 4.58, p = 0.28; interaction p = 0.05). Similarly, O3-FA use was associated with lower <outcome>BPI average pain and pain interference scores at 24 weeks</outcome> compared with placebo among obese patients, but no significant difference between treatment arms in non-obese patients (interaction p = 0.005 and p = 0.01, respectively). In obese BC patients, O3-FA use was associated with significantly reduced AI arthralgia compared to placebo.
