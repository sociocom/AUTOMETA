A <intervention>Dietary</intervention> Intervention to Lower Serum Levels of IGF-I in BRCA Mutation Carriers. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and other markers of insulin resistance (IRm) might influence the penetrance of BRCA gene mutation. In a demonstration project on BRCA mutation carriers we tested the effect of the 'Mediterranean diet', with moderate protein restriction, on serum levels of IGF-I and IRm. <eligibility>BRCA mutation carriers, with or without breast cancer</eligibility>, aged <average-age>18‚Åª70 years</average-age> and <eligibility>without metastases</eligibility> were eligible. After the baseline examinations, women were randomized to an active dietary intervention or to a <control>control group</control>. The intervention group attended six full days of life-style intervention activities (cookery classes followed by lunch, sessions of walking for 45 min and nutritional conferences) over the next six months. <No-of-participants>213</No-of-participants> BRCA mutation carriers completed the <duration>six-month</duration> study. Women in the intervention group (<intervention-participants>110</intervention-participants>) showed <outcome>major changes in all the parameters under study</outcome>. They significantly <outcome>lost weight</outcome> (p &lt; 0.001), <outcome>fat mass</outcome> (p = 0.002), with reduced <outcome>hip circumference</outcome> (p = 0.01), <outcome>triglycerides</outcome> (p = 0.02) and <outcome>IGF-I</outcome> (p = 0.02) compared with controls. They also had a significantly higher <outcome>levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFI-BP3)</outcome> (p = 0.03) and a lower <outcome>IGF-I/IGFI-BP3 ratio</outcome> (p = 0.04). The reduction of serum levels of IGF-I was significantly associated with the reduction in the consumption of animal products (p = 0.04). Women in the intervention group showed significant improvements in IGF-I and in other IRm that might influence the penetrance of BRCA mutations.
