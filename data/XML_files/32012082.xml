Feasibility and Health Benefits of an <intervention>Individualized Physical Activity</intervention> Intervention in <eligibility>Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</eligibility>: Intervention Study. There is limited knowledge regarding the potential benefits of physical activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The Advanced stage Breast cancer and Lifestyle Exercise (ABLE) Trial aimed to assess the feasibility of a physical activity intervention in women with metastatic breast cancer and to explore the effects of physical activity on functional, psychological, and clinical parameters. The ABLE Trial was a single-arm, <control>6-month</control> intervention study with a home-based, unsupervised, and personalized walking program using an activity tracker. At baseline and 6 months, we assessed <outcome-Measure>anthropometrics, functional fitness, physical activity level, sedentary behavior, quality of life, fatigue, and tumor progression</outcome-Measure>. Paired proportions were compared using the McNemar test and changes of parameters during the intervention were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the Mann-Whitney test, and Spearman rank correlations. Overall, <No-of-participants>49</No-of-participants> participants (mean age <average-age>55 years</average-age>; recruitment rate 94%) were enrolled and 96% adhered to the exercise prescription (attrition rate 2%). Statistically significant improvements in the <outcome>6-minute walking distance test</outcome> (+7%, P<&lt;.001) and <outcome>isometric quadriceps strength</outcome> (+22%, P<&lt;.001), as well as decreases in <outcome>body mass index</outcome> (-2.5%, P=.03) and <outcome>hip circumference</outcome> (-4.0%, P<&lt;.001) were observed at 6 months. <outcome>Quality of life</outcome> remained stable and a nonstatistically significant decrease (-16%, P=.07) in fatigue was observed. The high recruitment and adherence rates suggest the willingness of patients with metastatic breast cancer to participate in a physical activity program. The beneficial outcomes regarding physical fitness and anthropometry of this unsupervised physical activity program may encourage these patients to maintain a physically active lifestyle. Future randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03148886; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03148886.
