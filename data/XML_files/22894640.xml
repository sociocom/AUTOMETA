<intervention>Omega-3 fatty acids</intervention> are protective against <condition>paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy</condition>: a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial. Axonal sensory peripheral neuropathy is the major dose-limiting side effect of paclitaxel. Omega-3 fatty acids have beneficial effects on neurological disorders from their effects on neurons cells and inhibition of the formation of proinflammatory cytokines involved in peripheral neuropathy. This study was a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing incidence and severity of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN). Eligible <eligibility>patients with breast cancer</eligibility> randomly assigned to take omega-3 fatty acid pearls, 640 mg t.i.d during chemotherapy with paclitaxel and one month after the end of the treatment or <control>placebo</control>. Clinical and electrophysiological studies were performed before the onset of chemotherapy and one month after cessation of therapy to evaluate PIPN based on "reduced Total Neuropathy Score". <intervention-value>Twenty one</intervention-value> patients (<intervention-value>70%</intervention-value>) of the group taking omega-3 fatty acid supplement (n = <intervention-participants>30</intervention-participants>) did not develop <outcome>PN</outcome> while it was <control-value>40.7%</control-value>( <control-value>11</control-value> patients) in the placebo group(n = <control-participants>27</control-participants>). A significant difference was seen in <outcome>PN incidence</outcome> (OR = 0.3, .95% CI = (0.10-0.88), p = 0.029). There was a non-significant trend for differences of PIPN severity between the two study groups but the <outcome>frequencies of PN</outcome> in all scoring categories were higher in the placebo group (0.95% CI = (-2.06 -0.02), p = 0.054). Omega-3 fatty acids may be an efficient neuroprotective agent for prophylaxis against PIPN. Patients with breast cancer have a longer disease free survival rate with the aid of therapeutical agents. Finding a way to solve the disabling effects of PIPN would significantly improve the patients' quality of life. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01049295).
