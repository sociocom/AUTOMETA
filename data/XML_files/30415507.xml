<intervention>Supervised versus autonomous exercise training</intervention> in breast cancer patients: A multicenter randomized clinical trial. There is a well-known correlation between obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and breast cancer incidence and outcome. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft Medikamentöse Tumortherapie (AGMT) exercise study was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial and assessed the feasibility and efficacy of physical training in <No-of-participants>50</No-of-participants> <eligibility>breast cancer patients undergoing aromatase inhibitor treatment</eligibility>. <eligibility>Postmenopausal, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients under aromatase inhibitor treatment</eligibility> were randomized 1:1 to counseling and unsupervised training for 48 weeks (<control>unsupervised arm</control>) or counseling and a sequential training (supervised arm) with a supervised phase (24 weeks) followed by unsupervised physical training (further 24 weeks). Primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>individual maximum power output on a cycle ergometer after 24 weeks of exercise</outcome-Measure>. A key secondary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>feasibility of achieving 12 METh/week (metabolic equivalent of task hours per week)</outcome-Measure>. <control-participants>Twenty-three</control-participants> patients (92%) in the unsupervised arm and <intervention-participants>19</intervention-participants> patients (76%) in the supervised arm with early-stage breast cancer completed the study. After 24 weeks, the supervised arm achieved a significantly higher <outcome>maximum output in watt</outcome> (mean 132 ±  standard deviation [SD] 34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 117-147) compared to baseline (107 ± 25; 95%CI 97-117; P = 0.012) with a numerically higher output than the unsupervised arm (week 24 115 ± 25; 95%CI 105-125; P = 0.059). Significantly higher <outcome>METh/week</outcome> was reported in the supervised arm compared to the unsupervised arm during the whole study period (week 1-24 unsupervised: 18.3 (7.6-58.3); supervised: 28.5 (6.7-40.1); P = 0.043; week 25-48; P = 0.041)). This trial indicates that patients in an exercise program achieve higher fitness levels during supervised than unsupervised training.
