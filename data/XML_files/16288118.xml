<intervention>Tamoxifen</intervention> for the prevention of breast cancer: current status of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 study. Initial findings from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P-1) demonstrated that tamoxifen reduced the risk of estrogen receptor-positive tumors and osteoporotic fractures in <eligibility>women at increased risk for breast cancer</eligibility>. Side effects of varying clinical significance were observed. The trial was unblinded because of the positive results, and follow-up continued. This report updates our initial findings. Women (n = <No-of-participants>13,388</No-of-participants>) were randomly assigned to receive <control>placebo</control> or tamoxifen for <duration>5 years</duration>. Rates of breast cancer and other events were compared by the use of risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Estimates of the net benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen therapy were compared by age, race, and categories of predicted breast cancer risk. Statistical tests were two-sided. After 7 years of follow-up, the <outcome>cumulative rate of invasive breast cancer</outcome> was reduced from <control-value>42.5</control-value> per <control-participants>1000</control-participants> women in the placebo group to <intervention-value>24.8</intervention-value> per <intervention-participants>1000</intervention-participants> women in the tamoxifen group (RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.70) and the <outcome>cumulative rate of noninvasive breast cancer</outcome> was reduced from <control-value>15.8</control-value> per <control-participants>1000</control-participants> women in the placebo group to <intervention-value>10.2</intervention-value> per <intervention-participants>1000</intervention-participants> women in the tamoxifen group (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.89). These reductions were similar to those seen in the initial report. Tamoxifen led to a <intervention-value>32%</intervention-value> <outcome>reduction in osteoporotic fractures</outcome> (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.92). Relative risks of <adverse-effect>stroke</adverse-effect>, <adverse-effect>deep-vein thrombosis</adverse-effect>, and <adverse-effect>cataracts</adverse-effect> (which increased with tamoxifen) and of <adverse-effect>ischemic heart disease</adverse-effect> and <adverse-effect>death</adverse-effect> (which were not changed with tamoxifen) were also similar to those initially reported. <outcome>Risks of pulmonary embolism</outcome> were approximately 11% lower than in the original report, and risks of endometrial cancer were about 29% higher, but these differences were not statistically significant. The net benefit achieved with tamoxifen varied according to age, race, and level of breast cancer risk. Despite the potential bias caused by the unblinding of the P-1 trial, the magnitudes of all beneficial and undesirable treatment effects of tamoxifen were similar to those initially reported, with notable reductions in breast cancer and increased risks of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer. Readily identifiable subsets of individuals comprising 2.5 million women could derive a net benefit from the drug.
