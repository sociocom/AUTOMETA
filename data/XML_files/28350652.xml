Role of <intervention>Mitomycin C</intervention> in Preventing <condition>Capsular Contracture</condition> in Implant-Based Reconstructive Breast Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Capsular contracture represents the most frequent complication after implant-based breast reconstruction. An experimental study on mice demonstrated that capsule formation around breast implants is considerably diminished after topical application of mitomycin C. The authors conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial investigating the efficacy of mitomycin C in reducing capsular contracture rates following implant-based breast reconstruction after mastectomy for breast cancer. The authors randomized all women <average-age>older than 18 years</average-age> <eligibility>scheduled for the second stage of an implant-based breast reconstruction after mastectomy for breast cancer</eligibility> at the National Cancer Institute in <location>Milan</location> <duration>from October of 2005 to February of 2010</duration> to receive or not receive the topical application of mitomycin C during surgery. The authors assessed capsular contracture, major postoperative complications, and aesthetic outcome. The authors randomized <No-of-participants>322</No-of-participants> patients to receive mitomycin C or not at the second stage of implant-based breast reconstruction. <intervention-participants>One hundred sixty-two</intervention-participants> patients were allocated to the mitomycin C group and <control-participants>160</control-participants> patients were allocated to the <control>control group</control>. The <outcome>relative risk of capsular contracture</outcome> in the mitomycin C group was <intervention-value>0.92</intervention-value> (95 percent CI, 0.60 to 1.41). <outcome>Major complications</outcome> leading to reintervention, oncologic outcomes, and aesthetic outcomes were comparable between the two groups. This is the first trial reporting data about the use of mitomycin C in breast reconstructive surgery in a clinical setting. Mitomycin C seems not to significantly affect capsular contracture rate and severity following implant-based reconstructive breast surgery at the tested doses. Therapeutic, I.
