Randomized trial of <intervention>fenretinide</intervention> to prevent <condition>second breast malignancy</condition> in <eligibility>women with early breast cancer</eligibility>. Fenretinide, a vitamin A analogue, has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of fenretinide in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer. We randomly assigned <No-of-participants>2972</No-of-participants> women, aged <No-of-participants>30-70 years</No-of-participants>, <eligibility>with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ</eligibility> to receive for <duration>5 years</duration> either fenretinide orally (200 mg/day) or <control>no treatment</control>. The primary end point was the incidence of <outcome-Measure>contralateral breast cancer</outcome-Measure> or <outcome-Measure>ipsilateral breast cancer</outcome-Measure> 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by <outcome-Measure>menopausal status</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>incidence of distant metastases</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>overall mortality</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>tumors in other organs</outcome-Measure>. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two-sided. At a median observation time of 97 months, there were <outcome>no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer</outcome> (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an <outcome>interaction was detected between fenretinide treatment and menopausal status</outcome> in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41-1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46-0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82-2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75-1. 89). There were <outcome>no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all-cause mortality</outcome>. Fenretinide treatment of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women. These studies, particularly the post hoc analyses, are considered exploratory and need to be confirmed.
