<intervention>Tamoxifen</intervention> as adjuvant after surgery for breast cancer and tamoxifen or <control>placebo</control> as chemoprevention in healthy women: different compliance with treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate whether tamoxifen toxicity and treatment discontinuations differed in the adjuvant versus chemopreventive setting. At our Institutions <No-of-participants>119</No-of-participants> <eligibility>postmenopausal breast cancer patients</eligibility> were randomized <duration>from August 1987 to March 1995</duration> to tamoxifen only within adjuvant studies (International Breast Cancer Study Group studies VII and IX) and 202 healthy hysterectomized women aged <average-age>35-70 years</average-age> were randomized <duration>from November 1993 to May 1996</duration> in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled chemoprevention study (Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study). The tamoxifen dose was 20 mg/day for <duration>5 years</duration> in all studies. Median age was <average-age>66 years (54-85)</average-age> in the adjuvant studies and <average-age>53 years (37-69)</average-age> in the chemoprevention study. Median treatment duration was 238 and 120 weeks, respectively. Patients treated within adjuvant studies experienced more <adverse-effect>hot flashes, vaginal discharge and/or bleeding, bone marrow depression and weight gain</adverse-effect> than those treated in the chemoprevention study, consistent with the fact that a proportion of women in the latter study were receiving placebo. <outcome>Temporary discontinuation</outcome> occurred in <intervention-value>2.5%</intervention-value> of patients in the adjuvant studies and in <control-value>5.4%</control-value> of women in the chemoprevention study (difference not statistically significant). <outcome>Permanent discontinuation</outcome> was more frequent in the chemoprevention study than in the adjuvant ones (<control-value>26.7%</control-value> vs <intervention-value>15.1%</intervention-value>--P< 0.05). In summary, our data show that, although the toxicity of tamoxifen is superimposable in the two settings, a larger proportion of women treated as chemoprevention discontinue treatment spontaneously. Due to the double-blind nature of the chemoprevention study, the impact of the toxicity of tamoxifen upon compliance in the chemopreventive setting cannot be ascertained.
