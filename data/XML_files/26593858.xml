<intervention>Resistance training</intervention> improves <condition>fatigue</condition> and <condition>quality of life</condition> in previously sedentary breast cancer survivors: a randomised controlled trial. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of resistance training (RT) on quality of life (QOL) and fatigue in breast cancer survivors as an adjunct to usual care. We recruited <No-of-participants>39</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women who had survived breast cancer</eligibility> [mean <average-age>age (y) 51.9 ± 8.8</average-age>; time since diagnosis (m) 11.6 ± 13.2]. Primary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>fatigue</outcome-Measure> as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT) scale and <outcome-Measure>QOL</outcome-Measure> as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) scale. ANCOVA was used to assess the change in the primary outcomes while controlling for baseline values, with effect sizes (ES) displayed as partial Eta squared. The experimental group received supervised RT 3 days per week in a university clinic for 16 weeks. <outcome>Perceptions of fatigue</outcome> improved significantly in the RT group compared to controls [mean (SD) 6.7 (7.5) points vs. 1.5 (3.7) points], (P = 0.006, ES = 0.20) as did <outcome>QOL</outcome> [6.9 (8.5) points vs. 1.6 (4.4) points], (P = 0.015, ES = 0.16). We demonstrated both statistically and clinically important improvements in fatigue and QOL in response to RT in breast cancer survivors.
