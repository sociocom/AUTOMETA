Effect of <intervention>decision aid</intervention> for breast cancer prevention on decisional conflict in <eligibility>women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation</eligibility>: a multisite, randomized, controlled trial. Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation are at high risk for breast cancer and must make important decisions about breast cancer prevention and screening. In the current study, we report a multisite, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a decision aid for breast cancer prevention in <eligibility>women with a BRCA mutation with no previous diagnosis of cancer</eligibility>. Within 1 month of receiving a positive BRCA result, women were randomized to receive either <control>usual care (control group)</control> or decision aid (intervention group). Participants were followed at 3, 6, and 12 months; were asked about preventive measures; and completed standardized questionnaires assessing <outcome-Measure>decision making</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>psychosocial functioning</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>One hundred fifty</No-of-participants> women were randomized. <outcome>Mean cancer-related distress scores</outcome> were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group at 6 months (P = 0.01) and at 12 months postrandomization (P = 0.05). <outcome>Decisional conflict scores declined over time</outcome> for both groups and at no time were there statistical differences between the two groups. The decision aid for breast cancer prevention in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation is effective in significantly decreasing cancer-related distress within the year following receipt of positive genetic test results.Genet Med 19 3, 330-336.
