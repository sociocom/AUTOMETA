A pilot study of <intervention>minocycline</intervention> for the prevention of <condition>paclitaxel-associated neuropathy</condition>: ACCRU study RU221408I. Paclitaxel is associated with both an acute pain syndrome (P-APS) and chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Given that extensive animal data suggest that minocycline may prevent chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity, the purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of minocycline for the prevention of CIPN and the P-APS. <eligibility>Patients with breast cancer</eligibility> were enrolled prior to initiating neoadjuvant or adjuvant weekly paclitaxel for <duration>12 weeks</duration> and were randomized to receive minocycline 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg twice daily or a matching <control>placebo</control>. Patients completed (1) an <outcome-Measure>acute pain syndrome questionnaire daily during chemotherapy to measure P-APS</outcome-Measure> and (2) the <outcome-Measure>EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 questionnaire at baseline, prior to each dose of paclitaxel, and monthly for 6 months post treatment, to measure CIPN</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>Forty-seve</No-of-participants>n patients were randomized. There were no remarkable differences noted between the minocycline and placebo groups for the <outcome>overall sensory neuropathy score of the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 or its individual components</outcome>, which evaluate tingling, numbness and shooting/burning pain in hands and feet. However, patients taking minocycline had a significant reduction in the daily <outcome>average pain score</outcome> attributed to P-APS (p = 0.02). Not only were <outcome>no increased toxicities</outcome> reported with minocycline, but there was a significant <outcome>reduction in fatigue</outcome> (p = 0.02). Results of this pilot study do not support the use of minocycline to prevent CIPN, but suggest that it may reduce P-APS and decrease fatigue; further study of the impact of this agent on those endpoints may be warranted.
