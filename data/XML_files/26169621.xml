BREATH: <intervention>Web-Based Self-Management</intervention> for Psychological Adjustment After Primary Breast Cancer--Results of a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial. Early breast cancer survivors (BCSs) report high unmet care needs, and easily accessible care is not routinely available for this growing population. The Breast Cancer E-Health (BREATH) trial is a Web-based self-management intervention to support the psychological adjustment of women after primary treatment, by reducing distress and improving empowerment. This multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial evaluated whether care as usual (CAU) plus BREATH is superior to <control>CAU alone</control>. BREATH is delivered in sixteen fully automated weekly modules covering early survivorship issues. Two to 4 months post-treatment, BCSs were randomly assigned to receive CAU + BREATH (n = <intervention-participants>70</intervention-participants>) or CAU alone (n = <control-participants>80</control-participants>) using a stratified block design (ratio 1:1). Primary outcomes were <outcome-Measure>distress (Symptom Checklist-90)</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>empowerment (Cancer Empowerment Questionnaire)</outcome-Measure>, assessed before random assignment (baseline, T0) and after 4 (T1), 6 (T2), and 10 months (T3) of follow-up. Statistical (analysis of covariance) and clinical effects (reliable change index) were tested in an intention-to-treat analysis (T0 to T1). Follow-up effects (T0 to T3) were assessed in assessment completers. CAU + BREATH participants reported significantly <outcome>less distress</outcome> than CAU-alone participants (-7.79; 95% CI, -14.31 to -1.27; P = .02) with a small-to-medium effect size (d = 0.33), but <outcome>empowerment</outcome> was not affected (-1.71; 95% CI, 5.20 to -1.79; P = .34). More CAU + BREATH participants (<intervention-value>39</intervention-value> of <intervention-participants>70</intervention-participants> [<intervention-value>56%</intervention-value>]; 95% CI, 44.1 to 66.8) than CAU-alone participants (<control-value>32</control-value> of <control-participants>80</control-participants> [<control-value>40%</control-value>]; 95% CI, 30.0 to 51.0) showed <outcome>clinically significant improvement</outcome> (P = .03). This clinical effect was most prominent in low-distress BCSs. Secondary outcomes confirmed primary outcomes. There were no between-group differences in primary outcomes during follow-up. Access to BREATH reduced distress among BCSs, but this effect was not sustained during follow-up.
