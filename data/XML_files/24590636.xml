Randomized, controlled trial of <outcome>yoga</outcome> in <eligibility>women with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy</eligibility>. Previous research incorporating yoga (YG) into radiotherapy (XRT) for women with breast cancer finds improved quality of life (QOL). However, shortcomings in this research limit the findings. <eligibility>Patients with stages 0 to III breast cancer</eligibility> were recruited before starting XRT and were randomly assigned to YG (n = <intervention-participants>53</intervention-participants>) or <control>stretching</control> (ST; n = <control-participants>56</control-participants>) three times a week for 6 weeks during XRT or <control>waitlist</control> (WL; n = <control-participants>54</control-participants>) control. <outcome-Measure>Self-report measures of QOL</outcome-Measure> (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form survey; primary outcomes), <outcome-Measure>fatigue</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>depression</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>sleep quality</outcome-Measure>, and five saliva samples per day for 3 consecutive days were collected at baseline, end of treatment, and 1, 3, and 6 months later. The YG group had significantly greater increases in <outcome>physical component scale scores</outcome> compared with the WL group at 1 and 3 months after XRT (P = .01 and P = .01). At 1, 3, and 6 months, the YG group had greater increases in <outcome>physical functioning</outcome> compared with both ST and WL groups (P &lt;.05), with ST and WL differences at only 3 months (P &lt;.02). The group differences were similar for general health reports. By the end of XRT, the YG and ST groups also had a reduction in <outcome>fatigue</outcome> (P &lt;.05). There were no group differences for <outcome>mental health and sleep quality</outcome>. <outcome>Cortisol slope</outcome> was steepest for the YG group compared with the ST and WL groups at the end (P = .023 and P = .008) and 1 month after XRT (P = .05 and P = .04). YG improved QOL and physiological changes associated with XRT beyond the benefits of simple ST exercises, and these benefits appear to have long-term durability.
