<intervention>Acupuncture</intervention> for cancer-related <condition>fatigue</condition> in patients with breast cancer: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with breast cancer. We conducted a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial comparing acupuncture with enhanced usual care. <No-of-participants>Three hundred two</No-of-participants> <eligibility>outpatients with breast cancer</eligibility> participated. We randomly assigned <control-participants>75</control-participants> patients to <control>usual care</control> and <intervention-participants>227</intervention-participants> patients to acupuncture plus usual care (random assignment of 1:3 respectively) with minimization controlling for baseline general fatigue and maintenance treatment. Treatment was delivered by acupuncturists once a week for <duration>6 weeks</duration> through needling three pairs of acupoints. The usual care group received a booklet with information about fatigue and its management. Primary outcome was <outcome-Measure>general fatigue at 6 weeks</outcome-Measure>, measured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI). Other measurements included the <outcome-Measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General quality-of-life scale</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>expectation of acupuncture effect</outcome-Measure>. Analyses were by intention to treat. <No-of-participants>Two hundred forty-six</No-of-participants> of 302 patients randomly assigned provided complete data at 6 weeks. The difference in the mean <outcome>General Fatigue score</outcome>, between those who received the intervention and those who did not, was -3.11 (95% CI, -3.97 to -2.25; P &lt;.001). The intervention also improved all other <outcome>fatigue aspects measured by MFI</outcome>, including Physical Fatigue and Mental Fatigue (acupuncture effect, -2.36 and -1.94, respectively; both at P &lt;.001), anxiety and depression (acupuncture effect, -1.83 and -2.13, respectively; both at P &lt;.001), and quality of life (Physical Well-Being effect, 3.30; Functional Well-Being effect, 3.57; both at P &lt;.001; Emotional Well-Being effect, 1.93; P = .001; and Social Functioning Well-Being effect, 1.05; P &lt;.05). Acupuncture is an effective intervention for managing the symptom of CRF and improving patients' quality of life.
