<intervention>Intraoperative radiotherapy</intervention> versus <intervention>external radiotherapy</intervention> for early breast cancer (ELIOT): a randomised controlled equivalence trial. Intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons allows the substitution of conventional postoperative whole breast irradiation with one session of radiotherapy with the same equivalent dose during surgery. However, its ability to control for recurrence of local disease required confirmation in a randomised controlled trial. This study was done at the European Institute of Oncology (<location>Milan, Italy</location>). Women aged <average-age>48-75 years</average-age> <eligibility>with early breast cancer, a maximum tumour diameter of up to 2·5 cm, and suitable for breast-conserving surgery</eligibility> were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (using a random permuted block design, stratified for clinical tumour size [&lt;·0 cm vs 1·0-1·4 cm vs ≥1·5 cm]) to receive either whole-breast external radiotherapy or intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons. Study coordinators, clinicians, and patients were aware of the assignment. Patients in the intraoperative radiotherapy group received one dose of 21 Gy to the tumour bed during surgery. Those in the external radiotherapy group received 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2 Gy, followed by a boost of 10 Gy in five fractions. This was an equivalence trial; the prespecified equivalence margin was local recurrence of 7·5% in the intraoperative radiotherapy group. The primary endpoint was <outcome-Measure>occurrence of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrences (IBTR)</outcome-Measure>; <outcome-Measure>overall surviva</outcome-Measure>l was a secondary outcome. The main analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01849133. <No-of-participants>1305</No-of-participants> patients were randomised (<control-participants>654</control-participants> to external radiotherapy and <intervention-participants>651</intervention-participants> to intraoperative radiotherapy) <duration>between Nov 20, 2000, and Dec 27, 2007</duration>. After a medium follow-up of 5·8 years (IQR 4·1-7·7), <intervention-value>35</intervention-value> patients in the intraoperative radiotherapy group and <control-value>four</control-value> patients in the external radiotherapy group had had an <outcome>IBTR</outcome> (p&lt;·0001). The <outcome>5-year event rate for IBRT</outcome> was <intervention-value>4·4%</intervention-value> (95% CI 2·7-6·1) in the intraoperative radiotherapy group and <control-value>0·4%</control-value> (0·0-1·0) in the external radiotherapy group (hazard ratio 9·3 [95% CI 3·3-26·3]). During the same period, <intervention-value>34</intervention-value> women allocated to intraoperative radiotherapy and <control-value>31</control-value> to external radiotherapy <outcome>died</outcome> (p=0·59). <outcome>5-year overall survival</outcome> was <intervention-value>96·8%</intervention-value> (95% CI 95·3-98·3) in the intraoperative radiotherapy group and <control-value>96·9%</control-value> (95·5-98·3) in the external radiotherapy group. In patients with data available (n=<intervention-participants>464</intervention-participants> for intraoperative radiotherapy; n=<control-participants>412</control-participants> for external radiotherapy) we noted significantly fewer <outcome>skin side-effects</outcome> in women in the intraoperative radiotherapy group than in those in the external radiotherapy group (p=0·0002). Although the rate of IBTR in the intraoperative radiotherapy group was within the prespecified equivalence margin, the rate was significantly greater than with external radiotherapy, and overall survival did not differ between groups. Improved selection of patients could reduce the rate of IBTR with intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons.
