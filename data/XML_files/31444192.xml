Effect of home-based <intervention>high-intensity interval training</intervention> and <intervention>behavioural modification</intervention> using information and communication technology on cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise habits among sedentary breast cancer survivors: habit-B study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. Maintaining high levels of physical activity helps to maintain and improve physical health and quality of life, and plays a role in reducing adverse effects due to cancer treatments. Moreover, a greater degree of cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality. However, there are no home-based programme for improving cardiorespiratory fitness using body weight exercises for breast cancer survivors. This study will assess the efficacy of the newly developed habit-B programme on maximum oxygen uptake compared with treatment as usual with wearable device. The effects of this programme on <outcome-Measure>exercise habits, level of physical activity, physical fitness and subjective indices</outcome-Measure> will also be investigated. This is a <duration>12-week</duration>, parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial. Allocation will be managed by a central server using a computer-generated random allocation sequence provided by an independent data centre. Participants will be assigned to the habit-B programme (high-intensity interval training, exercise counselling + guidance, home-based exercise support using information and communication technology, and a wearable device) or <control>treatment as usual</control> with a wearable device. Subjects will be <eligibility>sedentary women</eligibility> aged <No-of-participants>20-59 years</No-of-participants> <eligibility>who have received breast surgery in the past 2-13 months after the diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (stages I-IIa) and have never received chemotherapy except for hormone therapy</eligibility>. The primary endpoint is the change in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak; mL/kg/min) between the groups after 12 weeks of intervention. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Center Japan on 28 February 2019 (ID: 2018-347). The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. UMIN000036400.
