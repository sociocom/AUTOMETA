<intervention>Thoracic paravertebral regional anesthesia</intervention> for <condition>pain relief</condition> in <eligibility>patients with breast cancer surgery</eligibility>. The present study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of thoracic paravertebral regional anesthesia (TPVBRA) in patients with breast cancer surgery. In total, <No-of-participants>72</No-of-participants> patients undergoing breast cancer surgery were randomly divided into an intervention group and a <control>control group</control>; each group contained <intervention-participants>36</intervention-participant<control-participants>s></control-participants> subjects. Both groups received TPVBRA with 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine. In addition, subjects in the intervention group also received an additional 1 μg/kg dexmedetomidine. <outcome-Measure>Heart rate (HR)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>systolic blood pressure (SBP)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>diastolic blood pressure (DBP)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>pain intensity</outcome-Measure> (measured by visual analogue scale, VAS), and <outcome-Measure>analgesic consumption</outcome-Measure> were assessed; <outcome-Measure>adverse events</outcome-Measure> were also recorded. Significant differences were observed in <outcome>HR</outcome> (P &lt;.05), SBP (P &lt;.05), and <outcome>DBP</outcome> (P &lt;.05) at the 30-minute point during surgery between the 2 groups. In addition, the time of the first administration of analgesia (P = .043) and the <outcome>mean consumption of analgesic agents</outcome> (P = .035) in the intervention group were much better than those in the control group. However, no significant differences in <outcome>HR or VAS</outcome> were found at any time point after surgery (P > .05). Furthermore, similar <outcome>adverse events</outcome> were detected in both groups (P > .05). The results of this study showed that TPVBRA combined with bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine can enhance the duration and quality of analgesia without serious adverse events.
