Sector resection with or without <intervention>postoperative radiotherapy</intervention> for <eligibility>stage I breast cancer</eligibility>: <duration>20-year</duration> results of a randomized trial. To investigate how radiotherapy (XRT) adds to tumor control using a standardized surgical technique with meticulous control of surgical margins in a randomized trial with 20 years of follow-up. <No-of-participants>Three hundred eighty-one</No-of-participants> <eligibility>women with pT1N0 breast cancer</eligibility> were randomly assigned to sector resection with (XRT group) or <control>without (non-XRT group) postoperative radiotherapy</control> to the breast. With follow-up through 2010, we estimated <outcome-Measure>cumulative proportion of recurrence</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>breast cancer death</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>all-cause mortality</outcome-Measure>. The <outcome>cumulative probability of a first breast cancer event of any type after 20 years</outcome> was <intervention-value>30.9%</intervention-value> in the XRT group and <control-value>45.1%</control-value> in the non-XRT group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.82). The benefit of radiotherapy was achieved within the first 5 years. After 20 years, <intervention-value>50.4%</intervention-value> of the women in the XRT group <outcome>died</outcome> compared with <control-value>54.0%</control-value> in the non-XRT group (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.19). The <outcome>cumulative probability of contralateral cancer or death as a result of cancer other than breast cancer</outcome> was <intervention-value>27.1%</intervention-value> in the XRT group and <control-value>24.9%</control-value> in the non-XRT group (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.77). In an anticipated low-risk group, the <outcome>cumulative incidence of first breast cancer of any type</outcome> was <intervention-value>24.8%</intervention-value> in the XRT group and <control-value>36.1%</control-value> in the non-XRT group (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.07). Radiotherapy protects against recurrences during the first 5 years of follow-up, indicating that XRT mainly eradicates undetected cancer foci present at primary treatment. The similar rate of recurrences beyond 5 years in the two groups indicates that late recurrences are new tumors. There are subgroups with clinically relevant differences in risk.
