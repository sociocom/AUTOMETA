A randomised controlled trial of support group intervention after breast cancer treatment: results on <condition>anxiety</condition> and <condition>depression</condition>. Previous studies have demonstrated that between 20 and 30% of women treated for breast cancer have measurable signs of anxiety and depression compared with 6% in a population of healthy women. Depression has been proposed as a predictive factor for recurrence and survival. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if <intervention>psychosocial support</intervention> intervention could influence anxiety and depression during the first year after diagnosis. <eligibility>Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients</eligibility> were randomised between <duration>April 2002 and November 2007</duration> and stratified by adjuvant chemotherapy. Of <No-of-participants>382</No-of-participants> eligible patients, <intervention-participants>191</intervention-participants> + <control-participants>191</control-participants> patients were randomised to intervention group or <control>control group</control>, respectively. Control patients were subjected to <control>standard follow-up routines</control>. The Intervention group had support intervention at the Foundation Lustgården Mälardalen. The rehabilitation lasted one week on a residential basis followed by four days of follow-up two months later. We used the Swedish version of the HAD scale with a cut-off value greater than 10 for <outcome-Measure>clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety</outcome-Measure>. Support group intervention lowered <outcome>anxiety over time</outcome> (p &lt; 0.001) but <outcome>depression</outcome> was unaffected (p = 0.610). This prospective randomised trial of support group intervention in a large homogenous group of breast cancer women showed a statistically significant effect on lowering anxiety over time. No statistically significant effect of intervention could be seen on depression.
