Randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of a <intervention>lifestyle intervention</intervention> (ActWELL) in women invited to NHS breast screening. In <location>Scotland</location>, the incidence of breast cancer is predicted to rise significantly in the next few decades and while there are measures to support reductions in morbidity and mortality, the breast cancer community is currently exploring preventative opportunities including supporting weight management programmes in postmenopausal women. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a theory-based, community delivered, minimal contact, weight management (diet, physical activity and behaviour change techniques) programme (ActWELL) in <eligibility>women with a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2 attending routine breast cancer screening appointments</eligibility>. The study will be a four-centre, 1:1 parallel group randomised controlled trial of a <duration>12-month</duration> weight management intervention initiated in breast cancer screening centres, delivered by trained Breast Cancer Now lifestyle coaches in community settings. The intervention programme involves two intervention meetings with coaches plus (up to) nine telephone contacts over 12 months. The programme will focus on personalised diet (including alcoholic and sugary drinks) and physical activity habits. Behaviour change techniques include self-monitoring, goal setting, implementation intentions, action and coping plans. The study has a sample size of <No-of-participants>414</No-of-participants> women with a BMI >25 kg/m2 attending routine National Health Service breast cancer screening appointments. Measures will be taken at baseline, 12 weeks and at 12-month follow-up, complemented by qualitative interviews exploring perceived acceptability and impact on habitual behaviours. The two co-primary outcomes are <outcome-Measure>mean change in measured body weight</outcome-Measure> and <outcome-Measure>change in physical activity</outcome-Measure> between groups to 12 months. Secondary outcomes are <outcome-Measure>changes in eating habits, alcohol intake, sedentary time, quality of life, waist circumference, lipid, haemoglobin A1c and insulin profiles, blood pressure and cost-effectiveness of the intervention</outcome-Measure>. The protocol has been approved by East of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (17/ES/0073). All participants provide written informed consent. Dissemination will be through peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations. ISRCTN11057518; Pre-results.
