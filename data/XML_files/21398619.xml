Long-term outcomes of invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences after lumpectomy in NSABP B-17 and B-24 randomized clinical trials for DCIS. Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) is the most common failure event after lumpectomy for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We evaluated invasive IBTR (I-IBTR) and its influence on survival among participants in two National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) randomized trials for DCIS. In the NSABP B-17 trial (accrual period: <duration>October 1, 1985, to December 31, 1990</duration>), <eligibility>patients with localized DCIS</eligibility> were randomly assigned to the <control>lumpectomy</control> only (LO, n = <control-participants>403</control-participants>) group or to the <control>lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy</control> (LRT, n = <intervention-participants>410</intervention-participants>) group. In the NSABP B-24 double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (accrual period: <duration>May 9, 1991, to April 13, 1994</duration>), all accrued patients were randomly assigned to <control>LRT+ placebo</control>, (n=<control-participants>900</control-participants>) or <intervention>LRT + tamoxifen</intervention> (LRT + TAM, n = <intervention-participants>899</intervention-participants>). Endpoints included <outcome-Measure>I-IBTR, DCIS-IBTR</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>contralateral breast cancers (CBC)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>overall and breast cancer-specific survival</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>survival after I-IBTR</outcome-Measure>. Median follow-up was 207 months for the B-17 trial (N = <No-of-participants>813</No-of-participants> patients) and 163 months for the B-24 trial (N = <No-of-participants>1799</No-of-participants> patients). Of 490 <outcome>IBTR events</outcome>, 263 (53.7%) were invasive. Radiation reduced <outcome>I-IBTR</outcome> by <intervention-value>52%</intervention-value> in the LRT group compared with LO (B-17, hazard ratio [HR] of risk of I-IBTR = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33 to 0.69, P &lt;.001). LRT + TAM reduced <outcome>I-IBTR</outcome> by <intervention-value>32%</intervention-value> compared with LRT + placebo (B-24, HR of risk of I-IBTR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.95, P = .025). The <outcome>15-year cumulative incidence of I-IBTR</outcome> was <control-value>19.4%</control-value> for LO, <intervention-value>8.9%</intervention-value> for LRT (B-17), <control-value>10.0%</control-value> for LRT + placebo (B-24), and <intervention-value>8.5%</intervention-value> for LRT + TAM. The <outcome>15-year cumulative incidence of all contralateral breast cancers</outcome> was <control-value>10.3%</control-value> for LO, <intervention-value>10.2%</intervention-value> for LRT (B-17), <control-value>10.8%</control-value> for LRT + placebo (B-24), and <intervention-value>7.3%</intervention-value> for LRT + TAM. I-IBTR was associated with increased <outcome>mortality risk</outcome> (HR of death = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.45 to 2.96, P &lt;.001), whereas recurrence of DCIS was not. Twenty-two of 39 <outcome>deaths</outcome> after I-IBTR were attributed to breast cancer. Among all patients (with or without I-IBTR), the <outcome>15-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer death</outcome> was <control-value>3.1%</control-value> for LO, <intervention-value>4.7%</intervention-value> for LRT (B-17), <control-value>2.7%</control-value> for LRT + placebo (B-24), and <intervention-value>2.3%</intervention-value> for LRT + TAM. Although I-IBTR increased the risk for breast cancer-related death, radiation therapy and tamoxifen reduced I-IBTR, and long-term prognosis remained excellent after breast-conserving surgery for DCIS.
