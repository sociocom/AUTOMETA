No effect of <intervention>exercise</intervention> on urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and catecholamines in young women participating in a 16-week randomized controlled trial. Women with breast cancer have decreased levels of melatonin or its metabolite in plasma and/or urine. We measured <outcome-Measure>serum melatonin</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>catecholamines</outcome-Measure>, and <outcome-Measure>cortisol</outcome-Measure> in <No-of-participants>141</No-of-participants> <eligibility>sedentary young female participants</eligibility> in a clinical trial comparing 150 min/wk aerobic exercise for 4 months to no-exercise controls. Demographics, health surveys, body composition, sleep quality, fitness levels, and blood and urine samples were obtained at baseline and <duration>16 weeks</duration>. There were <outcome>no differences between groups at baseline in demographics, exercise, sleep habits, or study hormones</outcome>. There were also no significant differences between groups in any of the <outcome>hormones</outcome> at 16 weeks. Sixteen weeks of exercise had minimal effects on <outcome>melatonin secretion</outcome> of young women. There is convincing evidence that exercise protects against breast cancer, but this does not appear to occur through changes in melatonin secretion.
