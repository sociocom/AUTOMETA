<intervention>Cryotherapy</intervention> for the prevention of weekly paclitaxel-induced peripheral adverse events in breast cancer patients. This randomized phase II study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of cryotherapy in preventing <condition>peripheral neuropathy</condition> and <condition>dermatological adverse events</condition> in <eligibility>breast cancer patients treated with weekly paclitaxel</eligibility>. Patients treated with 12 weekly doses of paclitaxel for breast cancer were randomized (1:1) into a cryotherapy or <control>control group</control>. The primary endpoint was the <outcome-Measure>percentage of patients with a marked decrease in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Neurotoxicity (FACT-NTX) score</outcome-Measure>. The secondary endpoints were <outcome-Measure>Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) for peripheral neuropathy, and FACT-Taxane score</outcome-Measure>. <No-of-participants>Forty-four</No-of-participants> patients were randomly assigned to the cryotherapy (n = <intervention-participants>22</intervention-participants>) or control groups (n = <control-participants>22</control-participants>). The <outcome>percentage of patients with a marked decrease in FACT-NTX scores</outcome> was significantly lower in the cryotherapy group than in the control group (<intervention-value>41</intervention-value> vs. <control-value>73%</control-value>, p = 0.03). The <outcome>incidence of CTCAE grade ≥ 2 sensory</outcome> (p = 0.001) and <outcome>motor peripheral neuropathy</outcome> (p = 0.01), and <outcome>PNQ grade D or higher for sensory peripheral neuropathy</outcome> (p = 0.02), and <outcome>decrease in the FACT-Taxane score</outcome> (p = 0.02) were also significantly lower in the cryotherapy group than in the control group. There were <outcome>no serious side effects</outcome> associated with cryotherapy. Cryotherapy is an effective approach for prevention of peripheral neuropathy and dermatological adverse events in breast cancer patients treated with weekly paclitaxel.
