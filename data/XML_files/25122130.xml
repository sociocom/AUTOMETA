Effects of a Randomized Controlled Trial to Increase <intervention>Repeat Mammography Screening</intervention> in <ethinicity>Iranian</ethinicity> Women. Although mammography use has increased in developed countries, regular screening in developing countries including Iran remains low. Multiple frameworks, including the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), have been used to understand screening practices among Iranians. The HBM includes intrapersonal constructs such as perceptions of breast cancer and mammography. The TPB includes interpersonal and environmental constructs, such as perceived control and subjective norms. The current study had 2 objectives: (1) to examine changes in the HBM and TPB constructs and repeat mammography screening in women receiving either intervention and women in the control group and (2) to compare changes in the HBM and TPB constructs and repeat mammography screening across the 2 interventions. <No-of-participants>One hundred eight-four</No-of-participants> women from 3 randomly selected health centers in <location>Sanandaj, Iran</location>, participated. Eligibility criteria were being <average-age>50 years or older</average-age>, <eligibility>having received a mammogram in the past 2 to 3 years, and no intention to obtain a mammogram within the next year</eligibility>. The TPB and HBM participants exhibited greater <outcome>changes in the HBM and TPB constructs</outcome> and were more likely to have a mammogram relative to control participants. The TPB and HBM participants exhibited comparable <outcome>changes in constructs and repeat mammography</outcome>. Findings suggest both interventions equally improved mammography screening. Additional studies are furthermore warranted to address nonadherent Iranian women's needs in line with these conceptual models. Use of the HBM and TPB constructs in clinical practice may be helpful to promote continued screening among this population.
