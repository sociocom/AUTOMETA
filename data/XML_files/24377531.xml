The Kampo medicine <intervention>Goshajinkigan</intervention> prevents <condition>neuropathy</condition> in <eligibility>breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel</eligibility>. Goshajinkigan (GJG) is used for the treatment of several neurological symptoms. We investigated the efficacy of GJG and <control>mecobalamin (B12)</control> against neurotoxicity associated with docetaxel (DOC) in breast cancer patients. <No-of-participants>Sixty</No-of-participants> breast cancer patients were treated with DOC. <intervention-participants>Thirty-three</intervention-participants> patients (GJG group) received oral administration of 7.5 g/day GJG and <control-participants>27</control-participants> patients (B12 group) received oral administration of 1500 μg/day B12. Neuropathy was evaluated according to <outcome-Measure>DEB-NTC (Neurotoxicity Criteria of Debiopharm)</outcome-Measure>, <outcome-Measure>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTC)</outcome-Measure> ver.3.0, and a <outcome-Measure>visual analogue scale (VAS)</outcome-Measure>. This study employed a randomized open design. The <outcome>incidence of neuropathy</outcome> was <intervention-value>39.3%</intervention-value> in the GJG group, and <control-value>88.9%</control-value> in the B12 group (p&lt;.01). In the GJG group, <outcome>grade 1 DEB-NTC</outcome> was observed in <intervention-value>2</intervention-value> cases, <outcome>grade 2</outcome> in <intervention-value>5</intervention-value> cases and <outcome>grade 3</outcome> in <intervention-value>5</intervention-value> cases. <outcome>Grade 1 NCI-CTC</outcome> was observed in <intervention-value>7</intervention-value> cases, <outcome>grade 2</outcome> in <intervention-value>6</intervention-value> cases, and <outcome>VAS</outcome> was 2.7 ± 2.2. In the B12 group, <outcome>grades 1, 2 and 3 DEB-NTC</outcome> were observed in <control-value>one</control-value> case, <control-value>12</control-value> cases and <control-value>12</control-value> cases, respectively; and <outcome>grades 1, 2 and 3 NCI-CTC</outcome> were observed in <control-value>11</control-value> cases, <control-value>12</control-value> cases and <control-value>one</control-value> case, and <outcome>VAS</outcome> was 4.9 ± 2.4. Concomitant administration of GJG is useful in preventing neuropathy in breast cancer patients treated with a DOC regimen.
